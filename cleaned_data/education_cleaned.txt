student burnout challenges may complex insurmountable subtle shifts practice classrooms remain safe productive spaceseven spring students wired focus transient motivation grades feedback mindset results disengagement grades start drop research shows students see grades feedback tend ignore constructive comments leading declines performance example basic grading approach teachers might take leave strings comments student work often either go misunderstood unread entirely upgrade grades feedback often get conflated one another former evaluative measure feedback objective determination student progress toward specific criteria success teachers short time elevate grades expense meaningful feedback process make room helping students gain deeper understanding need accomplish successful leverage little time day shifting focus summative grading formative feedback suppose students created research presentations role carbon photosynthesis science class teacher might return presentations strings comments inexplicable grade attached instead teacher provide feedback list criteria students start presentation process items provided students list criteria advance presentations likely meet expected standard also feedback process streamlined teacher lower levels frustration result added clarity ease type burnout teachers students feel achievement atrophies second part school year midyear students may lose interest classes might find routines repetitive real connection course content personal experience also decreases meaningful cognitive engagement hurts student performance teachers might try improve matters attempting tap student interest shifts often temporary superficial make kind lasting change upgrade although nurturing student interests certainly important approach limited power create lasting engagement often teachers overscaffold instruction lower standards make change two priorities must place first make sure work engaging meaningful second elevate student voice choice teachers elicit profound levels engagement must ensure ample opportunity engage higherorder thinking gradelevel content one way incorporate practice classroom give students ample guidance asking questions suppose sixthgrade social studies teacher complete daily lesson cultural practices ancient greece instead summarizing learning students far engaging move ask students craft perhaps
