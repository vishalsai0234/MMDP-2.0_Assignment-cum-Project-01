dont know ive hearing mixed things one hand one hand dealers say oh great least customers dont call time look app brian kenny course yeah stefan thomke hand also maybe loss control little bit used go dealer dealer would actually tell car go directly company company get information dont know quite honestly whether dealers super excited ive heard ive talked people said helps little bit keeping
