whose solutions belong number systems close relatives integers start numbers add different combinations get every integer say start different finite set numberslike add numbers different combinations get new number system called ring integers named even though ring need contain integers rings integers built sets numbers include say square root imaginary number mathematicians call cube root algorithm always determine whether given diophantine equation solutions fall one rings integers carlo pagano concordia university recently used expertise elliptic curves resolve major conjecture number theory mathematicians suspected every single ring integersthat infinitely many systems numbersthe problem still undecidable would extend conclusion well beyond initial integerfocused scope hilberts th problem prove hoped follow footsteps proof original problemthe one involving integer solutions general undecidability proofsproofs determine whether general algorithm answer given questionfollow recipe show problem interest equivalent famous undecidable problem computer science called halting problem halting problem asks whether idealized computational device called turing machine fed given input run forever eventually halt known theres algorithm answer every turing machine possible think diophantine equations computational devices consider equation x infinitely many integer solutions plug different integers x solve values get belong famous set integers perfect squares easy imagine computer program turing machine performs equivalent task compute sequence perfect squares diophantine equations encode kinds computations julia robinson played key role eventual proof hilberts th problem made one fundamental breakthroughs history mathematics said mathematician andrew granville yet somehow people gave prizes didnt give many settle hilberts original th problem mathematicians built idea work began julia robinson others around culminated matiyasevichs result shown every turing machine corresponding diophantine equation completely unexpected said hector pasten pontifical catholic university chile santiago diophantine equations integers enough define basically anything imagine moreover mathematicians set elegant correspondence turing machine halted given input corresponding diophantine equation would integer solution turing machine ran forever corresponding diophantine equation would solution meant hilberts th problem encoded halting problem algorithm could sort diophantine equations based whether integer solutions would also able sort turing machines based whether halted words hilberts th problem undecidable mathematicians hoped follow approach prove extended ringsofintegers version problembut hit snag useful correspondence turing machines diophantine equations falls apart equations allowed noninteger solutions instance consider equation x youre working ring integers includes youll end new solutions x equation longer corresponds turing machine computes perfect squaresand generally diophantine equations longer encode halting problem graduate student new york university named sasha shlapentokh started play ideas get around problem others formulated plan say add bunch extra terms equation like x magically forced x integer even different number system could salvage correspondence turing machine could done diophantine equations would mean hilberts problem could encode halting problem new number system years shlapentokh mathematicians figured terms add diophantine equations various kinds rings allowed demonstrate hilberts problem still undecidable settings boiled remaining rings integers one case rings involve imaginary number mathematicians realized case terms theyd add could determined using special equation called elliptic curve elliptic curve would satisfy two properties first would need infinitely many solutions second switched different ring integersif removed imaginary number number systemthen solutions elliptic curve would maintain underlying structure turned building elliptic curve worked every remaining ring extremely subtle difficult task koymans paganoexperts elliptic curves worked closely together since graduate schoolhad right tool set try since time undergraduate koymans thinking hilberts th problem throughout graduate school throughout collaboration pagano beckoned spent days every year thinking getting horribly stuck koymans said id try three things theyd blow face conference banff canada pagano ended chatting problem hoped together could build special elliptic curve needed resolve problem finishing projects got work peter koymans mathematician utrecht university thinking hilberts th problem since undergraduate started simple equation elliptic curve didnt satisfy either required properties knew could use wellestablished technique called quadratic twistsomething theyd studying better part decadeto tweak equation would meet first condition simply multiply one equations variables specific number theyd get new elliptic curve infinitely many solutions left problem way guarantee new curve satisfied second propertythat solutions would look similar rings differed imaginary number mathematicians needed get better control quadratic twist got stuck dark feeling koymans said started get suspicious missing something summer working different problem pair use quadratic twists one night middle research koymans found lying awake unable stop thinking hilberts th problem work koymans realized gave important hint one strange surprising mathematical concordances sometimes appear number used quadratic twist product exactly three prime numbers theyd get control needed guarantee second property elliptic curve constructed carefully meet many specifications lots additional constraints three primes could could koymans pagano find ones workedno matter ring using pagano happened planned visit swiss federal institute technology zurich koymans working time days later spent next week struggling blackboard together trying find primes would meet constraints finally figured use four primes rather three construct quadratic twist allowed apply method entirely separate area math called additive combinatorics ensure right combination primes existed every ring final piece theyd built elliptic curve gave recipe needed add terms diophantine equations enabled encode turing machinesand halting problemin equations regardless number system used settled hilberts th problem undecidable every ring integers result solidified last thursday less two months koymans pagano posted paper online independent team four mathematicians announced new proof result instead looking special elliptic curve relied different kind equation job groups hope use techniqueswhich give unprecedented control elliptic curves related equationsto make progress problems well theres possibility two methods could used together even said manjul bhargava mathematician princeton university one authors second proof meanwhile search undecidability ends decidability begins mathematicians continuing explore hilberts th problem new settings one many questions according
