fantasy baseball today spring training buzz shane mcclanahans rise grayson rodriguezs fall days opening day dont want totally change opinion players based happens spring training also dont want stick head sand avoid new information whole point friday newsletters try differentiate noise spring training stuff might actually matter one specific performance thursday reconsidering opinion one specific player shane mcclanahan mcclanahan coming back tommy john surgery couldnt bring rank much midround upside flier sight unseen ive ranking behind adp since first put rankings together watching start phillies thursday im rethinking looked really good four strikeouts one walk innings tell story course results really arent care spring care process mcclanahan less passed flying colors averaged mph fastball velocity got little better outing went averaged mph first inning second third innings physical characteristics pitch mostly looked line prior injury wasnt fastball changeup looked sharp generating four whiffs seven swings including several ugly chases added three whiffs slider curveball pitch didnt get whiffs six attempts overall finished swinging strikes swings pretty monstrous mark mostly looked like old shane mcclanahan mcclanahan given us one season true acelevel production muststart pitcher two seasons sure looked like guy thursday worse days come course days doesnt gets crushed think days probably bit common rays longer playing home games pitchers tropicana field still concerns much value mcclanahan likely provide course full season since rays find ways limit innings various points didnt throw single inning least im actively avoiding mcclanahan probably people drafts excited cant say im especially likely end teams im opposed one start thats pretty big shift rest todays newsletter going go handful storylines past week spring training try figure real isnt starting update one yesterdays injury situations get though want highlight something getting ready draft weekend draft prep walkthrough link everything need scott white frank stampfl draft best team possible keep one bookmarked well updating plenty opening day left wednesdays start early rodriguez said wasnt worried decided worried said injury concerned velocity design focused building arm strength earlier spring lie rodriguez diagnosed triceps soreness thursday reevaluated friday point dont details beyond enough justify drop rankings believe ill go step im going remove rodriguez breakouts column interest rodriguez mostly speculative begin solid floor skills betting step forward tweaks pitch usage general improvement overall skill set may still happen maybe injury less nonissue theyll clear throw soon weekend well barely remember issue way cy youngcaliber season harder make affirmative bet rodriguez taking step forward hes already dealing injury ill move rodriguez midround flier range draft get details hope doesnt totally derail season theres still plenty upside rodriguez say plenty pitchers arent currently injured de la cruz tools world next step development finding best ways put tools action consistently end de la cruz tweaked batting stance bit offseason standing taller plate open toward pitcher effort keep swing controlled cut leagueleading strikeout total hard argue results far de la cruz three homers four strikeouts first plate appearances spring dont believe mean sure de la cruz may take step forward age season believe dont much faith new setup plate suddenly going cure everything ails thats true every guy spent offseason reworking swing sometimes works course mookie betts turned power hitter thanks work driveline name one example also saw anthony volpe remake swing become arguably worse hitter second season others like ty france even worse offseason spent reworking swings unlike pitchers get look data points start model new pitch added velocity might mean projecting improvement hitters much tougher good see de la cruz dominating early spring hes also exactly expected far essentially tripleacaliber opposition per baseballreferencecoms spring stats wouldnt especially worried de la cruz strikeouts either clear way small sample size go im certainly going change opinion de la cruz based anecdotes new swing five games worth pa inconsistent competition soroka made second appearance spring thursday continued look absolutely terrific facing cardinals second time six days soroka limited one earned run scattering six hits four innings six strikeouts getting pitch count continuing throw even harder bullpen last season averaged mph thursday mph time white sox even first appearance hes generated seven whiffs across fourseamers sinkers adding three slider one four changeups soroka little doubt sustain velocity increase pushes sixinning outings yeah absolutely think knew could said first outing relief last year part still throwing multiple innings honest feeling fastball got end inning three really exciting feels like replicate believe look likeliest outcome soroka doesnt amount much fantasy hasnt thrown even innings mlb season since posted era innings since suffered two separate ruptured achilles tendon injuries along forearm injury shoulder issues past two seasons hes trying overcome slew injuries frankly looked like would totally derail career soroka showed real strikeout upside multiinning relief role white sox transitioning fourseamsliderheavy approach approach looks like might working even better fourseamer looks better ever sliders couple inches break across horizontal vertical planes could help play even whiff pitch soroka belonged lateround radar hh points leagues along simply starting pitcher relief eligibility ill draft basically sparp rotation spot even average production pretty valuable im starting move soroka ish range rankings even roto leagues case flashes hes showing spring real id bet finishing top pitcher season even gave pretty good odds would bet reynaldo lopez pulling trick time last year ill keep open mind im opening even every mids fastball throws past hitters talked alcantara last week since received report jeff passan indicates marlins plan limit alcantaras innings early season given alcantaras main appeal fantasy historically sheer overwhelming volume provides hes mound fair say hes going afterthought fantasy beginning season dont believe trouble believing marlins look limit alcantaras exposure early alcantara said much dont believe idea looking inverted garrett crochet situation marlins routinely limit four innings skip starts april may keep innings line thats say wont things limit alcantaras value hell pitching think worst team baseball means wins going tough come hes never really highstrikeout pitcher though think hell better strikeout rate new slider grip leading bit twoplane break pitch help probably wont fantasy ace early season think hell plenty appeal dont expect many sevenplus inning starts early season probably situations pulled five innings cruising pitches frustrating dont expect see many situations pulled four innings time may june roll around expect alcantara look less like theres long miami hold back course potential trade looms big boost value henderson diagnosed mild intercostal strain manager brandon hyde told reporters hopeful henderson ready opening day stopped short saying thats plan firstrounder missing significant time spring training chance miss opening day yeah thats tough stomach dont believe intercostal strains cost hitters average days per baseballprospectuscoms recovery dashboard tool would put henderson track return march follows timetable would put right cusp able return time end spring games last rd orioles would less ideal henderson return without getting back game wouldnt unprecedented memory serves corey seager made opening day lineup last season without playing spring game ahead time recovering injury move henderson spots first round yet really didnt go kind discount hh points salary capauction thursday night coming board price thhighest price night wanted push likes corbin carroll vladimir guerrero jr wouldnt argue much im ready go yet gausman managed piece together decent fantasy season despite clearly best stuff veteran put era innings despite opening season shoulder injury derailed spring strikeout rate collapsing well far spring gausmans velocity back levels averaged mph fourseamer wednesdays spring start thats pretty close gausman best sure feels like good sign believe mostly im entirely convinced gausman back prior clear velocity good sign theres difference couple innings six innings plus times movement gausmans splitter isnt quite past either getting couple inches less vertical break last year already getting couple inches less vertical break thats small thing given much gausman relies splitter whiffs without best splitter gausman wont able replicate upside thats certainly something well want keep eye next couple weeks pretty much completely gausman coming spring thinking chances age bounceback pretty slim well likeliest outcome ive moved gausman outside top rankings closer ill teams case get back gil diagnosed lat strain yankees general manager brian cashman acknowledged thursday hes going miss significant time starter hes got six weeks minimum throw obviously could longer takes longer cashman said theyll reimage remri see hes rest period six going seven weeks eight weeks whatever well get going hes got go flatground throwing program obviously bullpens rehab games youre talking three months feels like something close worstcase scenario injury gil figures miss least first two months regular season avoids setbacks believe mean youre league bunch il spots play hes fine stash three fewer il spots work think going extremely hard keep gil around season starts remember weve still got days season starts injuries opening day account plus usual slew earlyapril injuries contend highlight point heres il stash rankings piece last april scott white identified cantdrop players plus another really difficult drop total youd want stashed end april stashable players scotts updated list gil talented pitcher long shot repeat last years success even injury totally derailed spring highs era bunch strikeouts value even iffy whip something worth waiting especially since injury increases degree difficulty gil even youre keeping track spring training lineups might noticed awful lot rodriguez early going already logged pa twothirds total last spring two weeks left exhibition schedule thats coincidence conjunction rodriguez looking nongame reps live pitching goal making sure avoids slow starts become characteristic young outfielder im trying get reps prepare little bit better hit ground running rodríguez told mlbcom last week theres better training league pitchers weve got believe necessarily hes getting extra reps grapefruit league action though im certain cant hurt mostly dont believe rodriguezs slow starts likely continue one way another much longer rodriguez career hitter march april really quite bad obviously comparison ops north july august september also still talking plate appearances scattered across three seasons one came yearold rookie prior mlb experience perfectly acceptable ops may even like hes uniformly disastrous early season thats say fluke hes gotten slow starts think hell figure whatever caused slow starts maximizing early exposure live pitching helps im rodriguez remains one talented players league im happy draft discount season hope puts together entire season first time
