	Todd Spangler NY Digital Editor President Trump wants to vindicate late baseball great Pete Rose, who was banned by Major League Baseball from the game for life and from eligibility to be inducted into the Hall of Fame legacy over his gambling activities. Late Friday, Trump’s thoughts turned toward seeking to exonerate Rose, with the president saying he plans to issue a “complete PARDON” of the controversial ballplayer. That came after Trump earlier in the day made global headlines for attacking Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky at a White House meeting for being “disrespectful” to the U.S. for not showing gratitude over the Trump administration’s efforts to broker a peace deal with Russia, which launched a war on Ukraine in 2022.

					'Severance' Stars John Turturro and Christopher Walken on That 'Dinner From Hell' and Why Irving Visits Burt’s House: 'Curiosity, Insecurity, Jealousy' Trump, in a post Friday evening on his Truth Social social media platform, wrote that over the next few weeks “I will be signing a complete PARDON of Pete Rose, who shouldn’t have been gambling on baseball, but only bet on HIS TEAM WINNING.” Trump wrote that Rose “never betted against himself, or the other team. He had the most hits, by far, in baseball history, and won more games than anyone in sports history.”




			Popular on Variety It’s unclear what Trump’s pardon of Rose might entail or whether it would influence the MLB to reconsider Rose’s status. In 1990, Rose pleaded guilty to two charges of filing false federal income tax returns related to his baseball memorabilia sales, autograph signings and personal appearances, and he served five months in prison. In 1989, Major League Baseball banned Rose from the game for life over accusations that he bet on games while playing for and managing the Reds. Rose denied the accusations for years before admitting in his 2004 autobiography “My Prison Without Bars” that he had gambled on Reds games when he managed the team. In 1991, the Baseball Hall of Fame voted to ban those on the “permanently ineligible” list from induction, preventing Rose’s chances of being selected for the honor. Rose had applied for reinstatement multiple times over the years but was always denied. In 2016, Rose was inducted into the Cincinnati Reds Hall of Fame. According to Trump, “Major League Baseball didn’t have the courage or decency to put the late, great, Pete Rose, also known as ‘Charlie Hustle,’ into the Baseball Hall of fame. Now he is dead, will never experience the thrill of being selected, even though he was a FAR BETTER PLAYER than most of those who made it, and can only be named posthumously. WHAT A SHAME!” The president wrote that “Baseball, which is dying all over the place, should get off its fat, lazy ass, and elect Pete Rose, even though far too late, into the Baseball Hall of Fame!” Rose died Sept. 30, 2024, at the age of 83. The 17-time MLB All-Star currently holds the league record for most career hits (4,256) as well as games played, at-bats and outs made. Rose played 24 seasons in Major League Baseball from 1963-1986, taking the field in multiple different positions. He was known for his professional playing time with the Reds’ “Big Red Machine,” which won back-to-back World Series titles in 1975 and 1976. He also had brief stints with the Philadelphia Phillies and Montreal Expos, winning another World Series title with the Phillies in 1980.

TITLE: Dave Bautista on Joining Milla Jovovich and Paul W.S. Anderson ‘In the Lost Lands’ and Why He Doesn’t Gauge His Career by His Performances

	J. Kim Murphy Dave Bautista was introduced to most moviegoers as Drax, the brutal but kind-hearted warrior of Marvel’s “Guardians of the Galaxy” franchise. In the decade since, he’s taken his share of tough guy roles, in the 007 entry “Spectre” and the “Dune” franchise, but the 56-year-old actor has also developed his tender side with standout dramatic turns, playing a teacher with visions of the apocalypse in “Knock at the Cabin” and an insecure incel influencer in “Glass Onion: A Knives Out Mystery.” Now starring in director Paul W.S. Anderson’s post-apocalyptic feudal Western “In the Lost Lands,” Bautista shines as a more old-fashioned hero: a royal-employed gun-slinger in the distrustful, lonely mold of spaghetti Western rough riders. For the actor, the role was worth relishing.

					OVO Sound Ups Lauren 'Shug' Ritzer to General Manager (EXCLUSIVE) “It’s a new type of character for me. It’s a little outside of my comfort zone. He felt like that cool, dark mysterious gunslinger,” Bautista tells Variety, before breaking into a grin. “I was never really that kind of leading man, then was thrust into this world where Paul was like, ‘You’re gonna be cool! You’re gonna be dark and mysterious! You’re gonna be sexy! And you’re not only gonna get the girl, you gotta get every girl in the film!'”




			Popular on Variety Read the full conversation with Bautista about “In the Lost Lands” below. If I’m a fan of somebody that I’m about to work with, I always find it more comfortable just getting it right out of the way. You never know how people are going to react to it, but I wear my heart on my sleeve. I told her right off the bat, “This is a little nerve-racking for me, because you’re on a huge pedestal for me.” She was so easy-going about it. But there were more than a few times where I was in the scene and I was like, “Holy shit… Fucking Milla Jovovich.” It wasn’t really a particular conversation, just because we talked about it so much. I didn’t really understand the technology, so Paul just let me look at it. He showed me what he was looking at while we were filming. I’m looking at nothing but blue walls, but he’s actually looking at this world. It helped me get a vision of what it was. It was very intimate. I had great actors and a lot of practical things that were on set, so I didn’t have to stretch my imagination. He made it super easy for me. When I go back to projects that I did a year ago, two years ago, six months ago, I watch my performance and think, “I would have done this different, I would have done that different.” I’m proud of how far I’ve come. I’m proud that I’ve become a better actor after every film that I’ve done. I take criticism from people very well, because it kind of rolls off my shoulder. They’re not criticizing me harder than I’m criticizing myself. I don’t look back on films and think there’s something that I’m particularly proud of. But that’s just me. That’s a pressure I put on myself and that’s me growing as an actor. I gauge my career on who I’m working with, even with wrestling. I can look back and say I’m really proud that I got to share scenes with Milla Jovovich, with Jodie Foster and Sir Ben Kingsley. That’s a sense of pride that I carry and I’m very open about it. Hell yeah, I’m proud of that. But as far as me and my performance — you’d be hard-pressed to hear me say, “Yeah, I’m really proud of that.” “In the Lost Lands” is now playing in theaters.

	Jennifer Maas TV Business Writer SPOILER ALERT: This story contains spoilers for Season 2, Episode 8 of “Severance,” now streaming on Apple TV+. Harmony Cobel (Patricia Arquette), the former manager of the Severed Floor, has been acting like she’s more important to Lumon than she gets credit for since the beginning of “Severance” — and in Episode 8 of Season 2, she justifies it. In this installment, titled “Sweet Vitriol,” Harmony appears for the first time on screen since she drove off at the end of Episode 2, leaving Mark (Adam Scott) to wonder what she knows about him, Gemma/Ms. Casey (Dichen Lachman) and Lumon’s overall mission. When she shows up again, she’s returned to the impoverished, tiny hometown where she grew up to ask for help from her childhood friend Hampton (James Le Gros) in getting back into the home where her mother died, since she’s on bad terms with her aunt Sissy Cobel (played by Jane Alexander).

					Dolly Parton Thanks Fans for Support After Death of Husband Carl Dean: 'He Is in God's Arms and I Am Okay With That' Among the many discoveries “Severance” viewers make in this episode about Harmony Cobel and her past — including that she worked in a Lumon-run ether factory as a child, and left the dangerous job when she was accepted into a special Lumon fellowship program — is that Harmony created the first plans and schematics for the severance chip.




			Popular on Variety By the end of the episode, Harmony has left home once more, and is presumably driving back toward Mark after learning from Devon (Jen Tullock) that he has been successfully reintegrated. Here, Variety speaks with Arquette about diving into Harmony’s past with episode director Ben Stiller — plus, why she says “Mark” like that. I knew that Harmony had gone to a school and that she had worked at this ether factory, and that her mom had become an ether addict, and that Lumon had environmentally poisoned the town through their industrialization of everything. We had always talked about this as being an origin story aspect of it. There were different points in time where we talked about the possibility of Cobel having something to do with some aspect of the chip, definitely, because even though she didn’t get any acknowledgement of it, it carried within her the entitlement of somebody who had more to do with things structurally than maybe this organization will acknowledge. The way that this belief system works — like a lot of things, like the military or whatever — it’s all for the glory of the organization. It’s all for the glory of Kier. It’s not about you, not about the individual. It’s about the organization, what the organization needs. Here’s this person who will never get the acknowledgement from the people that she wants it most from: her aunt and Lumon itself. I think Harmony has a deep conflict about this company. Her mom was a rebel, and her mom was angry at Lumon. And some of that that I think is also within Harmony. Harmony never got to have that kind of mother love. The organization separated kids from their parents, so she didn’t get that kind of maternal bonding. And then when you have a drug addict parent, you’re never going to get it, because they’re disconnected in that kind of a way. The place itself, it’s very enlightening about Harmony’s inner landscape. This was the norm — this kind of coldness, this kind of strangeness. These were the proletarian of that time. These were the early incubators. This place was the incubating space for Lumon. And ether is the drug of forgetting. It in itself feeds into the chip. I think a lot of people see Harmony as a bad guy — now she’s going to confront her own bad guy, her aunt, and this cold place where her mother died. And she didn’t get any closure, she didn’t get to say goodbye. This cold room when her mom died alone. And then you have to say goodbye to people, and you will never get closure with them. They’re not capable, and it just wasn’t meant to be that way. So I think she’s mourning that when she’s in that room. But it was really nice to be able to see the set designer and the props department, and everybody who made these spaces that we’ve been talking about since the first season. She had done some ether a few times when she was a kid with James’ character, Hampton. But her mom was such an addict, and it had taken her away into this dream state so much, stolen her mother from her, basically. So we had talked about just the awkwardness of the apparatus and how we were going to shoot that and so on. And then also incorporating historical things like, throughout time and throughout cultures, women have talked about keening — the sound of mourning, which has like animal kind of elements of loss. Going back to our essential animal self, the sadness and the pain that comes with loss. Ben and I talked about whale sounds, almost, and how he wanted to use that. So we talked about it and there was some freedom in it, and we did it a few different ways and different times. It’s really just going back to that place that I myself had cared for a lot of people who died, and then also had to let people go in my life that needed to be let go of. That can always be painful, and I think she’s crying a lot for herself, too. She really doesn’t have anyone to go to to really talk about how she feels about anything. And that’s part of why she really liked Ms. Selvig, because she got this pretend feeling of what it’s like to make friends and have people you chat with. We were making it up as we went along, but there were moments where I felt like really interesting things were happening from inside my character and inside his character. I was having him write this thing on a post, and then he ended up writing “human,” which was a really cool moment. I’ve got to ask Adam exactly what the prompt was I gave him. It definitely felt like we were in it a lot of the time. It was really fun to do that. It felt very free. It felt immediate, and it felt fun to play with these fellow actors like that. I came up with that when they were telling me how Harmony grew up in this place, and even just the lore of tempers and all the different things — there was an old world-ishness about it. So I knew I wanted to have this sound, since I knew that Harmony hadn’t really been raised so much by her mom as these figures of higher authority. And, I thought, authority has this certain tone. If you think about a drill sergeant, there’s a certain kind of meter and a certain kind of tone and a certain kind of authority. And then you think of all these different people in upper management, the way that upper management sounds. I think she had formed a sound based on her idea of what that is. And I don’t know, I was kind of playing around with watching a little bit of “Maude” before we started, and there was a certain way that Bea Arthur speaks, that there’s a tiny, tiny pinch of the tip of the hat to “Maude” also. And there’s some joy that I think Cobel has to luxuriate on his name. It means a lot to her. This interview has been edited and condensed.

TITLE: Adrien Brody Wins Oscar, Throws Out His Gum and Tells the Academy to Cut the Music So He Can Finish Speech: ‘I’ve Done This Before’

	Ethan Shanfeld Adrien Brody has won his second Oscar for best actor, for his role in Brady Corbet’s “The Brutalist.” He beat out Timothée Chalamet (“A Complete Unknown”), Colman Domingo (“Sing Sing”), Ralph Fiennes (“Conclave”) and Sebastian Stan (“The Apprentice”) for the statuette. Walking on stage to accept the trophy, Brody spit his chewing gum into his hand and threw it to his partner, Georgina Chapman. Toward the end of his lengthy and passionate speech, the Academy began to play Brody off with music. “I’m wrapping up, please turn the music off,” Brody said. “I’ve done this before. Thank you. It’s not my first rodeo, but I will will be brief.”

			Popular on Variety “Acting is a very fragile profession. It looks very glamorous, and at certain moments it is,” Brody said. “But the one thing that I’ve gained having the privilege to come back here is to have some perspective. No matter where you are in your career, no matter what you’ve accomplished, it can all go away. And I think what makes this night most special is the awareness of that, and the gratitude that I have to still do the work that I love.” To Brody, winning the best actor Oscar for a second time represents “a chance to begin again,” and he said he hopes he can prove that he’s worthy of such “meaningful and important” roles 20 years from now. Brody’s two Oscars are both for playing characters who survived the Holocaust. “I’m here once again to represent the lingering traumas and the repercussions of war and systematic oppression, and of antisemitism and racism and othering,” Brody said. “I pray for a healthier and a happier and a more inclusive world, and I believe if the past can teach us anything, it’s a reminder to not let hate go unchecked.” In 2003, Brody became the youngest person to win the Oscar for best actor at age 29, for his lead role in “The Pianist.” Had Chalamet won this year, he would have beaten Brody’s record by eight months. Brody joins a short list of actors who have won the Academy Award for best actor twice: Spencer Tracy, Jack Nicholson, Marlon Brando, Dustin Hoffman, Gary Cooper, Tom Hanks, Fredric March, Sean Penn and Anthony Hopkins. (Daniel Day-Lewis is the only person to win best actor three times.) In “The Brutalist,” a three-and-a-half-hour epic produced for only about $10 million, Brody plays the fictional architect László Tóth, who escapes Hungary to come to the United States. After a twist of fate, he begins working on an ambitious project for a wealthy businessman in Pennsylvania as he awaits for the arrival of his wife and niece. Distributed by A24, “The Brutalist” scored 10 Oscar nominations in total and won three — for best actor, cinematography and original score. See all the Oscar winners here.

	Michael Schneider Variety Editor at Large Perhaps we should call it the “Queen Elizabeth rule.” The Television Academy has unveiled a few new Emmy Awards rules tweaks, including one that should impact the guest performer categories. Under the new rule, any performer who had previously been nominated or has won in a lead or supporting category  can no longer shift to one of the guest performer races in the same role in future years. That has become a more common occurrence in this prestige TV age, when actors often play a high-profile role for a few years before departing — with the promise of still making short guest appearances in subsequent seasons. A good example is Claire Foy, who won the lead drama actress Emmy in 2018 for “The Crown.” She left that show after two seasons (as her role as Princess Elizabeth/Queen Elizabeth was transferred to Olivia Colman and then Imelda Staunton). But Foy would continue to make appearances in flashback form as the younger Elizabeth, earning her an Emmy nom for guest drama actress in 2021, which she won, and another nom in the category in 2024.

When he moved to recurring, the thesp was nominated in guest drama actor in 2018, 2019 and 2020. (He won in both 2018 and 2020.)




			Popular on Variety Here’s that rule change: “If a performer has been nominated or has won in a lead or supporting performer category, the performer will not be eligible to submit in a guest performer category in a subsequent Emmy year for playing the same character role in the same series. They may, however, continue to enter in a lead or supporting category.” That change goes into effect in time for the 77th Emmy Awards competition in 2025. Also changing this year is a shift in the directing races, where “an eligible individual or the identical team may now enter multiple achievements per category if the achievements are for different programs.” Per the Academy, directors could previously only submit only one entry per category. “This change will allow the director to submit an episode from each of the programs they directed,” the Academy said. Also on tap are several changes that will be implemented for the 78th Emmys in 2026. In casting: “to streamline the number of reality casting titles that are eligible for Emmy consideration, the following titles will be eligible starting with the 2026 Emmy competition:” And in the main title theme race, starting in 2026 “a main title theme must appear in 50% or more of eligible episodes submitted for the 2026 Emmy competition. The main title theme has been further defined as a musical fingerprint and calling card that is identifiable and unique to a show, thereby drawing an audience in by setting the show’s tone and what is to come.”

	Chris Willman Senior Music Writer and Chief Music Critic Speaking of “Abracadabra,” Lady Gaga may have pulled off the ultimate “Saturday Night Live” magic trick during her two musical numbers in this week’s episode: dancing furiously and singing live. That combination is not for every “SNL” musical guest, let alone one who is also expending energy as a host who’s appearing in nearly every sketch in the show. But Gaga pulled it off with “Killah” aplomb (if that’s not a phrase that would offend the catchy-superlative-averse characters in the closing skit). Gaga appeared in every segment of the 90-minute show but two, the only exceptions being the Trump-themed cold open and Weekend Update. But whatever effort she’d put into practicing lines for the sketches clearly hadn’t taken any time away from whatever hours were spent rehearsing the choreography for two musical numbers that made “hyperkinetic” feel like a woeful understatement.

			Popular on Variety Her second number was the live premiere of a track that only had been unveiled to the public about 48 hours before, when her new “Mayhem” album came out. In that short time, “Killah” has already become a fan favorite, with its retro-funk stylings, so many of her devotees at home were undoubtedly greeting this album cut at least as enthusiastically as if she’d brought out a greatest hit. Gaga traded red for purple in this second showcase — perhaps as a nod to the apparent Prince inspiration that nearly every early album review has cited in describing “Killah.” Going even more intensely wild-eyed for this appearance, she turned a significant part of the backstage at 8H into her playground, traversing the hallways with background dancers — including a laying-down, kicks-in-the-air moment caught by an overhead camera — before emerging into the mirrored set in front of the studio audience again. This return to that set found her rocking out with a full band, as opposed to the electro-pop of the opening number. A post shared by NOVA (@iriptheslit) An exhausting purple reign? It would seem so, but the conclusion of her second number didn’t mean she was done singing for the night, as she reappeared in regular-person drag minutes later for a final sketch that found her singing comedic material. And that wasn’t even her first singing appearance in one of the night’s sketches — earlier, she’d sung an irreverent parody version of “Wonderful Tonight” in a restaurant-set duet with Bowen Yang. Gaga’s other “SNL” highlights for the night included taking the piss out of herself with an opening monologue in which she gamely allowed the writers to pen gags about her “Joker” film and about having had R. Kelly as a musical accompanist the last time she hosted the show.

 As directors Yuval Abraham, Basel Adra, Hamdan Ballal, Rachel Szor took the stage to accept the best documentary Oscar for their work on “No Other Land,” they took the opportunity — in one of the only overtly political moments of the telecast — to make a robust plea for “a political solution” to the war in Gaza. “We call on the world to take serious actions to stop the injustice and to stop the ethnic cleansing of Palestinian people,” said Adra, a Palestinian journalist and activist. “About two months ago, I became a father, and my hope to my daughter that she will not have to live the same life I’m living now. … ‘No Other Land’ reflects the harsh reality that we have been enduring for decades and still resist.”

					'Severance' Stars John Turturro and Christopher Walken on That 'Dinner From Hell' and Why Irving Visits Burt’s House: 'Curiosity, Insecurity, Jealousy' Abraham, an Israeli journalist, spoke at length about why their film was a collaboration between Israelis and Palestinians. “We made this film, Palestinians and Israelis, because together, our voices are stronger,” he said. “We see each other, the destruction of Gaza and its people, which must end, the Israeli hostages, brutally taken in the crime of Oct. 7, which must be freed.”




			Popular on Variety Made by an Israeli-Palestinian collective, the documentary follows a Palestinian family as the Israeli government displaces them from their home in the West Bank. In the face of the destruction that occurs and the lives lost, Adra and Abraham form an unexpected friendship. In his speech, Abraham noted that he and Adra live “unequal” lives. “We live in a regime where I am free under civilian law and Basel is under military laws that destroy his life and he cannot control,” he said. “There is a different path, a political solution without ethnic supremacy, with national rights for both of our people. Abraham continued that U.S. foreign policy under the administration of President Donald Trump “is helping to block this path.” “Why can’t you see that we are intertwined, that my people can be truly safe if basil’s people are truly free and safe?” he said. Since “No Other Land” premiered at last year’s Berlin Film Festival, earning top documentary jury and audience prizes, the doc has been one of the most acclaimed titles of the year, going on to play at the Toronto, Vancouver and New York film festivals. Last February, film critic Guy Lodge wrote in his review for Variety that “the filmmaking here is tight and considered,” noting how while the film is undeniably timely, it “underlines that the situation has been at crisis point for a long time, whether or not it’s been grabbing international headlines.” Despite the film’s critical acclaim and Oscar win, it still remains without a U.S. distributor. In January, Abraham told Variety that he took the lack of distribution “as something that’s completely political. We’re obviously talking about the Israeli military occupation of the West Bank, and it’s very ugly…The conversation in the United States appears to be far less nuanced — there is much less space for this kind of criticism, even when it comes in the form of a film.” “No Other Land” had a limited theatrical run in New York City starting Jan. 31 and Los Angeles starting Feb. 7.

TITLE: Adam Lambert on Playing the Emcee in Broadway’s ‘Cabaret,’ and Why Its Anti-Fascist Themes Hit Even Harder Now Than When He Began the Run: ‘It’s Wild, How Relevant It Is’
DATE: Feb 26, 2025 12:42pm PT

	Chris Willman Senior Music Writer and Chief Music Critic Adam Lambert is currently living out a dream, playing the role of the Emcee in the current Broadway run of “Cabaret,” or, as it’s officially known in this production, “Cabaret at the Kit Kat Club.” That extended titling reflects just how immersive the club-like transformation of the August Wilson Theatre is meant to be, with Lambert as host to an intimate, in-the-round audience in his first leading role on Broadway, every bit as impishly sensual — or should it be sensually impish? — as you’d expect in the iconic part. But there’s also a bit of nightmare to this dream… not in how it’s working out for Lambert, who has scored wide plaudits for his take on the Emcee, but in the nature of the show itself, which is only light-spirited up to a very finite point. For all the theatrical delights it offers, this “Cabaret” hardly holds back  on the darker, anti-fascist themes that were first introduced in the 1966 musical drama, which takes place in pre-WWII Berlin, with the rise of Naziism forcing some of the characters to make hard choices. Few who enter this Kit Kat Club will leave without thinking a little or a lot about real-life worries they’ve brought in from the outside the theater. And no one is less likely to ignore them than Lambert, who as a gay, Jewish man, embraces both the mirth of his part and the show’s “it could happen here” topical undertones.

					A Rare Encounter With Dolly Parton's Elusive Husband, Carl Dean: What a Journalist Learned From Her Glimpse of the Couple at Home Lambert is five months into his half-year “Cabaret” run, following the role being originated in this production by Eddie Redmayne. He’s joined at the moment by “Moana” and “Mean Girls” star Auliʻi Cravalho as Sally Bowles, with both stars on board for one more month. (Orville Peck and Eva Noblezada step in March 31.) It’s not an overstatement to suggest that this is a role he was born to play, and it’s his extra fortune, good or mixed, to be doing it at a time when no one could have anticipated that “Cabaret” would feel so utterly freshly written. He spoke with Variety on his way to a recent matinee.




			Popular on Variety It can be interesting to talk to actors later in a run, and especially with something like “Cabaret,” which comes with so many layers… Has the show evolved in your mind over the course of the months you’ve been doing it? One hundred percent. And with the state of the world and all the things that are going on in our country, it’s so meta. Even more so than in rehearsals, which were before the current administration had gone into office and before the election went south, in my opinion. You know, it’s scary what’s going on, and in a way there’s a catharsis in telling the story every night as sort of a cautionary tale to audiences — like, “Hey, this can happen. It can get out of control.” I think we’re seeing that now. So there are moments in the second act now where I think the audience is more keyed into the themes than they were even at the beginning of the run. It’s wild, how relevant it is. There can’t be a lot of revivals of other 1960s shows that anyone could do where, over the course of a few months in the 2020s, there is a real sense of current events beginning to catch up that much or most of the audience is going to intuit. You know, I’m also a history nerd. I love watching documentaries and studying things, and so I’ve always loved this piece on just the level of it commenting on what happened in the ‘30s. I’m Jewish myself, so everything that happened with the Holocaust and Hitler and Germany is something that I’m pretty familiar with and that I’ve learned a lot about. So I knew that going into it, I would bring that understanding and that connection to it to the table. And then the other cool thing about this production is, they also focused on other types of “others” in society, and they really leaned into the queer community that a lot of people probably don’t know was there in Berlin in the ‘20s and super progressive and liberal. There’s a documentary out there called “Eldorado: Everything the Nazis Hate,” which is about Magnus Hirschfeld, the doctor who had the very first in the world — as far as we know it — LGBTQ center, so to speak, and was doing work with trans people for the first time, justifying their existence and helping them with therapy and guidance and building a community in Berlin for queer people. It was really forward-thinking. The Nazis came in and that was one of the first groups of people they went after. And yeah, we’re seeing that again. So there’s this cool intersection, for me personally, between my Judaism and my queer identity, and it really gets to come alive in the show. People who don’t know “Cabaret” may not be aware the show has a bit of a split personality [as conceived by songwriters John Kander and Fred Ebb and book writer Joe Masteroff]. Obviously, the idea that you’ll have a good time is a draw. And the show delivers on that… with some rather large asterisks as it goes along. One of the things I love is the dichotomy between the first act and the second act. The first act is really fun; this is obviously before the Nazis come into Berlin and start taking things away from people, and I love that the show reflects that. In the beginning the show has a sense of joy and freedom and a raunchy, perverse kind of fun. It’s like little naughty jokes, and we’re all loving on each other, and I get to be really kind of obnoxious, this nightclub host who’s got a dirty little mind and having a good old time. I get to really try to warm the audience up and have them drop their inhibitions a bit and just lean into the spirit. Then Act 2 comes and it’s obviously the idea that all these wonderful people that you’ve just fallen in love with are now having their rights and their existence being called into question. So hopefully it’s a piece where, when an audience leaves, it stays with them and it makes them think. I think that’s what’s so genius about the show. It is so much fun and then the light-heartedness goes away. But the question may be, do you need to feel guilty for having indulged in the initial fun? It always feels like it’s OK to come and get a kick out of it, and then get sobered up, but for almost 60 years, it’s challenged audiences to embrace both those things. Well, yeah. I have found myself, in moments, sort of scolding the audience for not paying attention in Act 2. And I try to be as understanding as possible. People are seeing this for the first time; some people don’t know the history; some people are caught up in the feeling of Act 1 and they’ve had some drinks and they think it’s all a good laugh. It all comes down to listening. Because it’s all in the text and the songs, all of the stuff we’re talking about. But it’s hard because you’re asking people to take this really hard left turn all of a sudden, in a live piece of entertainment. It is not easy to ask an audience to come with you on that. I think there’s probably some people, some nights, who are like, “No, I wany to stay and have fun! I don’t wanna go into the dark place.” But again, that’s all built into the message of what happened to all the people there, whose rights were taken away, who were vanished and sent to camps. You want to challenge the audience with complicated feelings so that they understand what the characters are going through. You actually made the news in New York for calling someone to the audience who was snickering in the wrong place to attention, one night. There’s a song in the show called “If You Could See Her” — it’s me with somebody in a gorilla costume. It’s meant to be sort of a satire; it’s supposed to feel like you’re back in the nightclub and you’re watching a vaudeville act again. But it’s aso commenting on this relationship between two of the supporting characters in the show, and the fact that one of them’s Jewish and one of them’s not, and the challenges that they’re beginning to face from society about wanting to be together. There’s a very powerful scene that precedes this song, and sometimes people just aren’t connecting that my role in the show is to comment on what you just saw. It’s difficult because it first feels like a cutesy little silly number, and then it takes a hard left with a monologue that’s talking about some real things. There’s a big mic-drop moment at the very end of the song where I say, “If you could see her through my eyes, she wouldn’t look Jewish at all.” It’s this famous moment because it’s finally saying what the satire in this song is about, and I think it comes out of nowhere for a lot of people. So there have been nights where there have been people that think it’s a joke, and they laugh. It’s meta, again, because if you’re not paying attention, that’s how we get to some of these terrible places in history. The first few times it happened, I just let it happen, and I went backstage and I was like, “OK, it’s my job as the storyteller here to guide them to this moment more carefully.” So when you’re asking about what it feels like going into a run (and letting the performance evolve)… I found ways in which to make sure I led them to the moment responsibly, with the setup of some of the other parts of the monologue, making sure they understand that this character’s upset by this and this is hard for him and he’s really worried and saddened by it. So I found over a couple weeks, as I messed with it, that I was able to sort of get ahead of any laughter there, for the most part. But occasionally it still happens. And I started going, “You know what? I’m gonna hold them accountable.” So I’ve stopped and found the person that was laughing, and I say, “No, this is not a joke. This is  real.” And I say it in character. One night, I just said, “Pay attention.” It’s a really powerful moment in the show to handle, and it’s a lot of pressure and has definitely been a tricky thing to figure out. But, as an actor, as a storyteller, I’m really grateful for the opportunity. Having read that you had said something to the audience at least once, I was kind of in suspense when I saw you do “If You Could See Her” — like, oh, what if there is inappropriate laughter, during what can be one of musical theater’s most shocking moments? But it felt like you drew out the lead-up, to set up that it would be a more serious moment. Yeah, that’s the change that I’ve made to it. Because when I started, I was playing more of that monologue for laughs, because there’s some easy laughs in there with the gorilla, and you can do some sight gags. Then I realized, no, no, no, no, that’s diluting the weight of that moment. And it’s not my first time hearing it, so I can’t be surprised or irritated that somebody is not understanding it. It’s my job to help them understand it. That’s what I’ve done, to the best of my ability. The emcee character is so unique in theater, as far as being a lead character we know almost nothing about, beyond a stage persona. We only ever see him when he’s on stage at the club and role-playing, except during “I Don’t Care Much”… Yeah. That moment is a bit different. … and, then, in however each production’s director chooses to portray the emcee in a silent final appearance. So with no information about the emcee’s life off-stage, there’s a lot for the audience to read into, and different ways to play it. Joel Grey is famous for playing it as this more sinister-feeling character. But the way you’re playing it is more kind of fun and, as you said, playfully raunchy, and it’s a little bit easier to sidle up to the emcee as someone we kind of like. Yeah. I think the joy of it is how, in the beginning, it’s really warming everybody up and turning on the charm and allowing them to have fun and laugh and be silly and escape into this world with us. I love the opening number. And it’s the narrator that breaks the fourth wall, so I have direct eye contact with them. Our brilliant director (Rebecca Frecknall) and the team have been really kind in allowing me to improv a bit in the beginning when we’re establishing that feeling of freedom in the Kit Kat Club. That’s been a real blast, too; just be able to react based on what happens every night is so much fun. It’s not set in stone. If someone claps really loudly or laughs at a joke and no one else laughs, I’ll look at them and play with them. There’s things that I get to react to in the audience that are happening in real time, which is a real treat. Do you have your own backstory for the emcee? Because based on how it’s played, people can interpret him as either complicit and a Nazi sympathizer, or a sympathetic victim of the creeping new order. Yeah. My take on it is that I think he is queer and working in this nightclub around his tribe of people. That’s his crew, the rest of the ensemble that works at the Kit Kat Club. These are his buddies, and they hang out and it’s a safe space for him and for everybody that comes in. He loves provoking the audience. He’s a little twisted, for sure. He’s not just a nice guy; he definitely has an edge to him. He wants to get a reaction out of people. But it’s all sort of in good fun. It’s like going to the Box in New York; it’s wild and weird and meant to be entertaining. And then my idea was, as Act 2 comes in and you start seeing how the characters in the story are being affected by the evil forces that are coming into the city, I wanted to show that he’s affected by it too. Who he is, being a queer man, and maybe Jewish for that matter, is at risk. And I wanted to show his fear. I think he’s terrified, and I think he’s a smart person and he starts going, “OK, what do I need to do in order to survive this? How do I cope personally, and how am I gonna survive?” His idea is to assimilate and take off all the makeup and weird clothes and blend in. I think that’s the theme of this production, and that’s what you see the rest of the cast do. By the end, everybody’s washed their faces off. There’s no more glitter. They’re all in drab, brown, tweed suits that all look the same. And I think he takes that cue and goes, “OK, I just have to keep my head down and not be an individual anymore. Because of these evil forces, I need to just blend in.” I mean, even during “Tomorrow Belongs to Me” in Act 1, which is a number that’s foreshadowing this darkness on the horizon, at the very end I take a blond wig out of a box. And that’s what I come out in at the end — he’s disguised himself to blend in like an Aryan German. So I think by the very end, he’s heartbroken, because all the things that he is, and all the freedom and space that Berlin gave him to be exactly who he was, are being taken away and he’s got to hide. I think that’s something I can relate to, being a queer person, is how so many of us spend so long hiding ourselves or apologizing and dealing with the shame that comes with that. So I think all those emotions come up for me at the end as like: He’s ashamed, he’s scared, he’s terrified. He is figuring out how to survive. It’s funny that seeing Adam Lambert in a blond wig and drab suit easily registers as a saddening moment. Yeah. That’s really depressing. Believe me, I have to take off every stitch of makeup. But it’s all for the story and for the art, and it brings the idea home that it’s no more fun and games. No more freedom. Let’s talk about “I Don’t Care Much,” since you went into the recording studio recently and cut that as a single. It’s another part of the show that can be interpreted in different ways, or as an all-of-the-above scenario. It could be you as the narrator finally truly singing your real thoughts, for the first time, rationalizing why you’re hardening yourself. Or, since you’ve got Sally there on stage that you’re addressing the song to, in a fantasy kind of way, it could be tht you’re vocalizing her thoughts as she toughens herself up and hardens herself. Definitely. Or, at least, there’s definitely a little bit of that. It exists in an abstract space because it’s the one song of his that’s not a number at the club. It’s the most most vulnerable that I get to be in the show. So it’s sort of mirroring Sally’s experience, but also, it’s a chance for me to show what he really feels like and is going through underneath all the costumes, so it’s almost like a internal monologue that they’re sharing, in a way. Sonically, I just love the song. It’s such a beautiful melody. I want to just sort of make it his torch song, you know? So we raised the key and put it in a spot where I could really take advantage of the jazz influence in the score there and make it sort of jazz/torch. I think the lyric is him trying to tell himself he doesn’t care, but he actually does. And you get to see that by the end of the number that, oh, no, he’s heartbroken. But his whole method of survival is blend in, put on a mask and pretend like it doesn’t bother you. The illusion of indifference is his defense mechanism. And then, for however it relates to the emcee and to Sally, it stands in as a song for Germany singing to itself. Or maybe America singing to itself now. Like, how do people get through these times and remain sensitive but find a buffer to not just internalize it all every day? Yeah. I mean, that’s the heartbreaking message of the song — that indifference and apathy are sort of the worst, most toxic way to deal with all the things that are going on. It mirrors Sally, who’s trying to pretend like everything’s fine and it’s all fun and games still, even though things are crashing down around her. And I think it mirrors something Cliff says to her: “If you’re not against this, you’re for it.” That’s a real powerful line, as well. I think what we’re in the middle of in our country right now is that there’s a lot of people that bury their heads in the sand because they just don’t know where to start, and they don’t want to deal with the pain and confusion of everything. Hey, I find myself doing it too. It’s difficult to face it every day. You scroll through social media right now and it’s really draining, because of all the coverage. But I think there’s a certain amount of self-care that we all should make sure we’re doing for ourselves. You know, you can take breaks from it. You’ve got to find ways to look after yourself and your mental health during all this. But then at the same time, try to get involved; try to become part of the counter-movement. Call a senator if something doesn’t agree with you. Get involved in a group or a petition. There’s ways we can get involved and still keep our sanity. I do think that this is a really pivotal moment where we’re gonna have to do stuff, because if we don’t, it’s gonna tip the wrong way. I think it’s pretty intense right now. And again, maybe one of the things I love about doing this production is that in my way, as an artist, as a creative, this is my part of my contribution. Hopefully, me as part of the cast and part of this team, we’re telling a story every night to audiences, and hopefully the takeaway is: I care about the people that are different. I care about freedom, I care about expression and individuality, and I don’t want to see this happen in my life and to the people that I care about. So it’s to try to build that sympathy in a way. I hope people leave and they go, “Oh man, I feel bad for these characters that are going through this.” And even if you’re somebody that maybe did vote for Trump and you are conservative and you do come to this show — and it’s an interesting show for somebody with those sets of morals and values to come see — if you’re sitting in the audience, maybe it’ll make you think twice about the consequences of those actions. And if you are on the other side of the fence, like all of us are on stage, I hope it strengthens your empathy and sense of community and sense of justice, and it makes you want to get involved and make a change. It’s a lot. It’s heavy. But again, I’m grateful for the opportunity to tell an important story. Just to pivot to a strictly professional subject… You have this huge background in theater, having toured with “Wicked” in its earliest touring days in the 2000s, and done plenty before that. But this is your first Broadway starring experience. Does your prior experience come back pretty naturally after spending all that time not doing theater? Or is there a different kind of energy that you need to rediscover? It’s been like riding a bike in some ways, for sure. This is my first love; this is what I grew up doing. This is what I did all throughout my twenties until I was 29 on “Idol.” So it’s something I know pretty well and it’s in my bones. But I was also in my twenties the last time I did a long run of a musical, so the bones are a little tired. It definitely takes a certain amount of physical stamina. But I think it’s good for my work ethic, and it’s a good challenge to show up to work and give it my all every night. And I really missed theater people and the community around the theater. I am a theater person. That’s what I am at my core. That’s my spirit; that’s where my heart is. And I love making my own music and exploring different genres, and I love being a recording artist and touring musician. But as far as the family that you get in a show, in a theater production, there’s nothing like it. So it very much feels like home for me, and feels familiar. In some ways doing this production has allowed me to sort of revisit an earlier part of my life, and that’s been really revitalizing for me and healing. It reminded me of the power of storytelling and the magic of working in a great team. I’ve absolutely loved it. The emcee in “Cabaret” was kind of like a bucket list role, as you’ve described it. Having been maybe spoiled by that experience, will you be looking for a chance to be on Broadway again? I’m sure it’ll happen again. I love it, and it’s a totally different outlet, and I’m sure something will come along at some point. I don’t have anything planned as of right now, except maybe a vacation when I’m done. But I would definitely be open and curious to do something else. It probably goes without saying, but one other thing I’d want to throw in there is, for anybody that is supporting the theater and coming and seeing us, we love you and appreciate you. You know, for everybody on stage in this production and all the productions in New York, this is not a mega-lucrative career path. This is hard work to get on stage eight shows a week, and everyone up there does it because they fucking love it and they’re passionate about it. You have to have that love in order to get into the theater every night to do it. So we really love audiences that come in and share that passion with us. And it’s reminded me of the amount of respect that should go to theater performers because it’s a lot of work. Every night we’ve gotta go out there and give it our all, and it’s inspiring to be around. You’re seeing a community of people do what they love and  beat the odds every night.

As for the film itself, Variety’s chief film critic Peter Debruge called “Anora,” a “whirlwind sex-work romance” that “sparkles like the tinsel in its leading lady’s hair.” Moreover, the film is “a profane kick,” Debruge writes in his review. “But seen in the context of Baker’s recurring fixations — from “Starlet” to “Red Rocket” — it stresses his belief that sex work is real work, that it’s more central to society than society wants to admit, and that by identifying with those we typically objectify, we can’t help but love them.” Directed by Sean Baker, “Anora” follows a stripper and sex worker named Anora (Mikey Madison), who falls for Ivan (Mark Eydelshteyn), the son of wealthy Russian oligarchs. However, when Ivan’s parents catch wind of their son’s spontaneous wedding, they send their handler and his muscle to put an end to their marriage. The film also stars Yura Borisov, Karren Karagulian, Vache Tovmasyan, Aleksei Serebryakov, Darya Ekamasova and others. Stream “Anora” in 4K Ultra HD.

TITLE: ‘1923’s Julia Schlaepfer On Her Harrowing Scenes At Ellis Island & What More To Expect From Her Journey To Montana
DATE: March 9, 2025 8:00am
CONTENT:
SPOILER ALERT! This story contains plot points from the latest episode of 1923 on Paramount+. The road trip from hell has only just begun for Alex. In the latest episode of the Yellowstone origin series, Spencer’s wife (played by Julia Schlaepfer) disembarks her ship after a precarious ocean voyage, only to encounter more horrors while passing through Ellis Island. Here, Schlaepfer looks back at the filming of the episode titled “Wrap Thee In Terror” and talks about what it’s like to work opposite Brandon Sklenar in the Taylor Sheridan series. “It’s like the dream love story I get to tell,” she says to Deadline. “I love a good love story, and this is an epic one, that’s for sure.”

					'1923' Season 2 Premiere Honors Late Cole Brings Plenty DEADLINE You and Brandon Sklenar have such great chemistry. Were you able to spend much time together before filming began in Africa for season one? 


			Watch on Deadline JULIA SCHLAEPFER Yes, actually we met during cowboy camp. It was the first day of cowboy camp where they brought all of the actors out to learn how to ride horses and to help everyone get into the western spirit. Brandon and I had a little over a month while everyone started filming in Montana before they flew us to Africa to start filming. We would ride horses every morning and then we’d eat every meal together. We got manicures and pedicures one time. So yeah, we did get some good quality bonding in. DEADLINE I don’t know if you’ve watched the first two episodes of season 2, but it’s already been pretty damn hard season on women. SCHLAEPFER Oh, I sure noticed. DEADLINE Let’s jump right into those Ellis Island scenes. That kind of detail isn’t usually depicted in film or TV when it comes to addressing how immigrants make their way into America. SCHLAEPFER Yeah, I agree. Taylor Sheridan does such incredible research about the history of our world. That’s what was so fun about 1883 because there’s just so much history in it to learn. He called me and said, ‘Alex is going to come through Ellis Island as an unwed pregnant woman. She’s going to be hurt and people will want to mess with her.’ He said he really wanted to write this story because it’s what would’ve happened. He asked, ‘are you okay with that? Because you’ll have to go through a lot as an actor.’ And I was like, yes, yes. It feels so important to me to tell this story. Every day on set, I’d walk in and see all these extras in their costumes with their Ellis Island tags, and it felt so real and so horrifying. So many people went through this and I felt honored that we got to tell that side of history. DEADLINE I was struck by the notion that Alex had to endure three different examinations. SCHLAEPFER I did my own research and I think what was interesting is how so much of what has been documented about Ellis Island has been positive. There are not a lot of people talking about the negatives of what people experienced. I think a lot of those stories have probably been passed down within families. My great-grandfather Valentino came through Ellis Island in the ’20s and he only had $15 in his pocket. From what I understand from my family, he was messed with a little bit. So it is horrible. It didn’t surprise me that Alex went through this kind of treatment. Even as a woman in the world in 2025, there’s a level of fear that I understand in regard to traveling alone. So I tried to bring as much of that to Alex. DEADLINE Alex is quite the standout with her blonde hair. SCHLAEPFER I think that was on purpose. The costume designer, Janie Bryant, is a genius. She said that she wanted me in light colors and everyone else in darker, more muted colors just because we’re following Alex’s journey. Alex is such a bright light and is so hopeful. She has so much love and spirit inside of her that the world is trying to strip away. DEADLINE You’re a native of Washington state. Is this your first go-around with an English accent? SCHLAEPFER I studied acting in college and we had dialect classes, so I had a base level of understanding. Then I had this incredible dialect coach, Jessica Drake, who has worked with me both seasons. This is my first time in any show or movie doing an accent, so I was a bit nervous because I didn’t want to mess it up. My director is British and I said to him, ‘if you hear anything wrong, you have to tell me because I am not going to mess this up.’ DEADLINE It really paid off when you’re in the office with that one immigration officer who asked you to read from a book. SCHLAEPFER It was so much fun. It was like a sigh of relief after all of the horrible things that she goes through. I filmed the assault scene on the same day she met with the immigration officer. It was a long day, and I just got to let him have it. He tries to belittle her and she is like, ‘I can read, what are you talking about?’ They also wanted to dehumanize these people as much as possible and test how much they really had to offer the country. In that moment he thinks that he’s so superior and she’s like, ‘Uh, I got you. I’m going to show you how it really is right now.’ DEADLINE How did you shoot that scene in the ship that was going through the choppy ocean waters? SCHLAEPFER It was a huge stunt rig. They built this giant box on a sound stage and moved it back and forth super violently. It was honestly kind of fun. There were all these incredible stunt performers just throwing themselves across the room. I’m supposed to be screaming and crying but when they called cut, I had the biggest smile on my face because it was so much fun. It felt like a roller coaster. DEADLINE We see how the episode ends. Some creep is following you in the bathroom, which can’t be good. SCHLAEPFER I will say that she’s only in New York City and she’s got to make it across the country, so the journey will not be easy. She’s not done with the hardships yet. She’s got a lot more to get through, but she’s tough. She is fighting her way. I think she’s proving to herself how strong she is and how much fight she can bring to the table. DEADLINE We are already seeing Michelle Randolph’s character Elizabeth wanting to leave the ranch because she can’t stand the life. I’m wondering if it will be as hard on Alex when she gets there. SCHLAEPFER I think that Alex wants it. This journey is preparing her for it, and I think she’s really built for it. I think her whole life, she’s wanted adventure. She’s wanted more. She knows what Spencer’s family goes through out there on the ranch from reading those letters. She wants it, and she wants to be with Spencer. So I think she’s going to be well equipped for that lifestyle. DEADLINE My fear is that we’re not going to get to see Alex’s reunion with Spencer until the final episode of season two. SCHLAEPFER I cannot say. But I’ve seen bits of the finale. The whole journey is so beautiful. I think people are going to be really happy with the way that everything happens.

TITLE: Sad Weekend For Lofty Priced, Original Sci-Fi Fare With ‘Mickey 17’ Opening To $19M+, But Keep This In Mind… – Box Office
DATE: March 9, 2025 9:54am
CONTENT:
SUNDAY AM WRITETHRU: Warner Bros and Plan B Entertainment’s Mickey 17 is being called at a $19.1M domestic, $43.6M global opening this morning (pic’s running worldwide tally is $53.3M) and that unfortunately isn’t going to cut it profit wise for this $118M original sci-fi production plus P&A which Warner Bros. decided to take a swing on with multi-Parasite Oscar winner Bong Joon Ho. But that’s from a motion picture studio standard of P&L measurement. Here’s what’s frustrating for those at Warner shepherding the film and those producing it. At a time when movie executives are trying to keep cinema alive with auteur driven, genre defying fare, Netflix has released their $320M Russo Brothers directed sci-fi robot original family film Electric State in two theaters this weekend with 24 showtimes – iPic Westwood and iPic Fulton Market with an average ticket price of $19.35. The grosses for Electric State will go unreported, and the global eyeballs on Netflix’s service using their own methodology for viewership (not a third-party) will celebrate that movie as a win. Electric State, which is more of a studio accountant’s nightmare, won’t be written up as a flop like Mickey 17. WTF?!

	










			Watch on Deadline Make no mistake, Mickey 17 is losing money in its first cycle, and the upcoming expensive auteurish gambles at Warner Bros has me worried, but in the end, many will likely remember Mickey 17 more for having some sort of impact on the culture than Electric State. Just because that’s how it goes when it comes down to the legacy of movies in cinemas vs. home TV movies. In the same breath, it’s hard to tap dance on Warner Bros. for Mickey 17 as they’re bound to make more money than Electric State years down the road. The 21st century mind is still confused how streamers make money off $300M-plus features. Why didn’t Mickey 17 work? Mickey 17 is not Parasite. Parasite was a clevery twisty noirish social commentary that had audences championing for those home invaders, not those who are the victims of the home invasion. Mickey 17 is Byzantine and cold in its execution. That’s why it isn’t bringing in a bigger audience. It’s no Gravity (which opened to $55.7M) also a Warner Bros movie, which pulled in women with Sandra Bullock and George Clooney, and had a lot of heart in it, working both as a popcorn and arthouse epic. The only solution here for a motion picture studio is that when they’re making original fresh IP, don’t spend a penny north of $100M. Just don’t. If Brady Corbet can make his three-hour The Brutalist for a net of under $10M (gross somewhere in the teens), that’s a film financial model all studios should strive for. (Domain has a 10% co-finance stake in Mickey 17). Global P&A is figured around $80M for Mickey 17; Warners did push this movie with a spot during the NFL playoff game. The movie was shot two years ago, and the release date was pushed by roughly a year. Mickey 17 was suppose to come out on March 29, 2024. The explanation for that? Bong was working with studio execs to get that trailer right. There’s an argument to be made that the push for Mickey 17 could have been louder, particularly with all the release date changes. A studio needs to spend more whenever they hop scotch a film around the calendar. There were reports that when the first trailer hit for Mickey 17, it wasn’t really a stone sending ripples in a pond. But that’s because the movie isn’t established IP. The campaign was tweaked to make Robert Pattinson‘s protag more relatable in an attempt to expand the audience to women and young men, demos which aren’t the target for sci-fi. However, a finger can be wagged at Warners for not executing a marketing stunt soon after that lackluster first trailer in the five months between the second in order to make-up that delta of awareness. Mickey 17 also skipped fanboy opps such as San Diego and NYC Comic-Con. This opening for Mickey 17 is unfortunately where original sci-fi has lived in recent years with 20th Century Studios/New Regency’s The Creator ($14M; granted impacted by the strikes) and Ad Astra ($19M), which Mickey 17 feels very close to in its deep space chill drama; that Brad Pitt feature getting a B- CinemaScore. Warners has been in this asteroid field before: Remember the $200M Wachowski siblings movie Jupiter Ascending? That was significantly more red ink on that movie which opened to $18.3M domestic. Gotta make sci-fi fun and emotional to work and break out, and you gotta control costs which is easier said than done. More under the hood on Mickey 17: 65% guys showed up with the largest demo being 25-34 at 38% and a third of the audience over 35. Diversity demos were 47% Caucasian, 24% Latino and Hispanic, notable 13% Asian American, 10% Black and 5% Native American. IMAX and PLF are accounting for big business on the movie with 48% of the weekend so far. Imax rang up $3M stateside or 16% of the weekend. The movie is playing in the West and the NorthEast which is where auteur original sci-fi plays. It’s an LA and NYC film. AMC’s Lincoln Square is the highest grossing venue with around $124K through Saturday. Some good news out of all of this? Mickey 17 was Bong Joon Ho’s biggest opening ever of his career in 59 markets including the U.S. There are more pricey auteur gambles at Warners ahead with Ryan Coogler’s Sinners at Easter, Paul Thomas Anderson’s untitled $140M epic inspired by Thomas Pynchon’s Vineland, and Maggie Gyllenhaal’s The Bride. That puts a lot of pressure on Legendary’s Minecraft and DC’s Superman to make up any red ink spilled by those titles. No matter how much money or jobs are lost, it’s the cinematic theatrical releases which will survive time. Comscore calcuated the whole weekend at $56M. It’s the tenth weekend of the year. A year ago, Kung Fu Panda 4 opened to $58.3M, and led a marketplace that counted $136.1M, hence this weekend was -59% off from that. The box office year of Jan. 1 – March 9 at $1.15 billion remains 1.28% ahead of the same period in 2024. Chart updated with Sunday figures: 1.)

In The Lost Lands (Vert) 1,370 theaters, Fri $391K, Sat $395K Sun $257K Sun 3-day $1.04M/Wk 1  FRIDAY AM: Warner Bros and Plan B Entertainment’s Mickey 17 did $2.5 million in box office previews Thursday night at 3,200 locations. Showtimes began at 3 p.m. for the sci-fi movie adapted and directed by Bong Joon Ho. Tracking has the pic hoping to do around $20M. The global outlook as we told you is around $45M. It’s an expensive movie given that it’s original sci-fi, with an initial greenlight of $118M before P&A. How that stacks up to other sci-fi movies: Mickey 17‘s previews are higher than that of Plan B’s other sci-fi movie Ad Astra from pre-Covid September 2019, which did $1.5M on its way to a $19M opening, a final domestic of $50M and $127.4M worldwide. That astronaut movie starring Brad Pitt cost $100M after reshoots. Mickey 17′s previews are also above the $1.45M in previews made by Denis Villeneuve’s Arrival  in November 2016, leading to a $24M opening. Yet, it’s below the $3.5M made by Villeneuve’s Blade Runner 2049, which went on to a $32.7M opening. PostTrak exits last night for Mickey 17 were very good at 4 stars and a 63% definite recommend. Always note, the fans are out first on a Thursday, in this case the Robert Pattinson and Bong followers. Rotten Tomatoes critics score is at 80% certified fresh, and audience score is at 81%. Hopefully that will give the latest from the multi-Oscar-winning Parasite filmmaker a lift this weekend. The rest of the week was as follows: 1.) Captain America: Brave New World (Dis) 3,800 theaters, Thur $920K (-10% from Wednesday), Wk $19.3M, Total $168M/Wk 3 2.) Last Breath (Foc) 3,018 theaters, Thur $511k (-8%), Wk $10.4M/Wk 1 3.)

TITLE: ‘The Accountant 2’ Review: Ben Affleck Has Brotherly Reunion With Jon Bernthal In Long-Awaited Sequel — SXSW
DATE: March 8, 2025 10:17pm
CONTENT:
Although sequels rarely surpass the original, Gavin O’Connor’s long-gestating The Accountant 2 is a pleasant surprise. Nearly a decade after The Accountant (2016), Christian Wolff (Ben Affleck) is brought out of hiding after his former federal contact Raymond King (J.K. Simmons) is killed while on a case. King’s successor Marybeth Medina (Cynthia Addai-Robinson) enlists his expertise in putting together the puzzle, for which Christian reconnects with his long-lost hitman brother Braxton (Jon Bernthal). While I admit I wouldn’t call myself the target audience, the original fell flat for me. I actually found myself questioning why a sequel was necessary, but fortunately, the follow-up stands perfectly on its own while delving further into the dynamics that felt halfheartedly introduced the first time around. And although Anna Kendrick’s absence as accountant Dana Cummings from the original is an unfortunate omission — albeit understandable given her busy year that includes another SXSW sequel — that gives the other characters a chance to shine.




			Watch on Deadline Affleck and Bernthal hit the perfect comedic chemistry as estranged brothers who still know how to push each other’s buttons, somewhat of a missed opportunity in the original, which barely had the pair sharing the screen until a wholly dramatic conclusion. In addition to some familiar faces from the first film, Daniella Pineda plays another deadly assassin with another form of acquired savant syndrome, which Affleck’s Christian also has, explaining his knack for forensic accounting. While her character’s heartbreaking story never quite feels complete (maybe something for the trilogy), Pineda brings a chilling intensity to the role, as well as some butt-kicking moves to shake up the male-driven action of the franchise. And while Christian and Brax’s parents are hardly referenced in this installment, letting the brothers focus on mending their own relationship, another familial crisis takes over as they seek to reunite an immigrant mother with her son after they were both trafficked. I’m not sure why there are so many absentee mothers in this franchise, but perhaps that’s something for O’Connor’s therapist to help him unpack. Regardless, the familial dynamics in the movie manage to tug at the heartstrings. And while everyone’s arc might not wrap up the way audiences hope, they all find what they truly need, whether it’s a stray cat, the perfect office chair or some good old fashion vengeance.

TITLE: John Goodman Injured During Filming Of Warner Bros Movie Starring Tom Cruise; UK Production Paused For Two Days
DATE: March 8, 2025 10:44am
CONTENT:
John Goodman has been injured during the production of Warner Bros and Legendary’s Alejandro González Iñárritu movie, which is filming in the UK. A Warner Bros Pictures spokesperson told us: “Actor John Goodman experienced a hip injury. He received immediate medical attention that led to a brief delay in shooting to allow him time to recover. The production resumes shooting next week following John’s full recovery.” We understand Goodman slipped during the past week while blocking a scene at the UK’s Pinewood Studios and was taken to hospital for treatment. We understand it led to filming being stopped for two days. It is described to us by sources as a relatively “minor injury” and the 72-year-old actor is expected back on set Monday. The untitled project, which began production late last year, is Oscar winner González Iñárritu’s first English-language film since The Revenant.

TITLE: Did Netflix’s Algorithm & Scheduling Doom ‘The Recruit’: Behind Surprise Cancellation Of Noah Centineo Series
DATE: March 9, 2025 10:51am
CONTENT:
In recognition of Noah Centineo‘s status as one of Netflix‘s top young stars, he served as a SAG Awards Ambassador for the streamer’s January 23 awards show telecast. Ten days later, Netflix canceled Centineo’s series, The Recruit, after two seasons. The cancellation was surprising in itself and in its swiftness; it came less than five weeks after Season 2 dropped on January 30. While Netflix rewards breakout newcomers with quick renewals — most recently comedy Running Point earlier this week was picked up for Season 2 just seven days after its debut — the streamer usually takes awhile for its cancellation decisions, analyzing the long tail of a show’s performance before making the call. That leaves bubble series in limbo for awhile — for instance, we are yet to learn the fates of freshman comedy No Good Deed, which debuted December. 12, and Heartstopper, whose third season dropped October 3. The cancellation after two seasons of another Netflix drama, Shadow & Bone, came eight months later, with impact from the strike a contributing factor.




			Watch on Deadline For The Recruit, there was a small red flag — its original Season 2 pickup, which matched the size of the eight-episode first season, was subsequently reduced by Netflix to six episodes. As a result, the writers, led by series creator and showrunner Alexi Hawley, had to condense the story, trimming some arcs and backstory. Six episodes is very short and rarely seen for a U.S. drama series. (The Diplomat did it in Season 2 upon request from its creator against Netflix’s wishes, returning to eight episodes in Season 3.). But there was impact from the strike, and an episode reduction from 10 episodes in Season 1 didn’t hurt Netflix comedy series XO, Kitty, whose eight-episode second season premiered two weeks before The Recruit’s second installment and was renewed for Season 3 a month later after netting impressive 27.1 million views in its first three weeks. Coincidentally, portions of The Recruit Season 2 filmed in Korea where XO, Kitty shoots, allowing Centineo to reprise his fan-favorite role as Peter from the To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before movies in the spinoff series’ second season. The abbreviated second season of The Recruit was well received, scoring 92% on Rotten Tomatoes, up from 68% for Season 1. Hawley also sounded upbeat about the series’ Season 3 prospects at the launch of Season 2. “We’re waiting for Netflix to officially do their thing with it,” he told Deadline at the time. “There’s a lot of goodwill inside Netflix towards the show and towards Noah; I think they very much feel like Noah is a homegrown star, which he is. So I’m feeling super positive about it, as positive as you can feel in this town at this time.” But it wasn’t to be. In his reaction to the cancellation, Hawley recalled how Season 2 “wasn’t a sure thing” as “completion was an early concern, ultimately overcome,” paving the way to the renewal. This time, I hear the Season 2 completion rate was great; it was the decline on overall eyeballs that sealed the show’s fate. Launching a week after Netflix released Season 2 of similarly themed spy drama The Night Agent, which may have overshadowed it, The Recruit ranked No. 2 behind The Night Agent in its first two weeks and spent a total of three weeks before dropping out of Netflix’s weekly Top 10 rankings for English-language series. Over those three weeks, The Recruit, whose second season featured a prominent Korea storyline and the addition of Teo Yoo to the cast, amassed 15.3 million views. That is 58% of the 26.4M views the show collected in its first three weeks of Season 1, when it spent five weeks in Netflix’s Top 10 under different methodology, based on total hours viewed. For comparison, in its first three weeks, Season 2 of The Night Agent, which received an early Season 3 renewal ahead of its second season debut, amassed 36.6 million views. That is also 58% of the 62.9M views for Season 1’s first three weeks. Of course, the drop was off a significantly larger base; The Night Agent’s first season remains in the Top 10 most watched English-language Netflix series of all time. Still, the action drama may also have been impacted by The Recruit as its retention for the first week of Season 1, ahead of Noah Centineo series’ arrival, was higher at 66%. It is unclear why Netflix chose to schedule The Night Agent and The Recruit –– two sophomore spy series with twentysomething male protagonists who are both idealistic CIA novices learning the craft as they go — back to back. Having them run side by side may have created confusion, with viewers possibly getting their fix with one spy show (more likely The Night Agent) and not eager to watch another right away. While both series may have been affected by the scheduling, The Recruit was the more vulnerable. It was already trying to overcome a long, 25.5-month gap between seasons which, given the show’s generic title, may have had casual fans forget about it. (The devoted ones did not, rewatching the first season ahead of Season 2 to send it back into the Top 10 for two weeks, something Netflix likes to see for returning series.) The Recruit also did not get the level of promotional support The Night Agent, which faced a slightly smaller gap between seasons (22 months), did as a Top 10 Netflix series. The Night Agent‘s Season 2 marketing push included a big skydiving stunt by star Gabriel Basso during Netflix’s highly watched Christmas NFL games. The streamer also organized a glitzy premiere event in New York, which was canceled at the last minute in the immediate aftermath of the L.A. fires. Meanwhile, there was no major campaign or red carper premiere for The Recruit Season 2. (Because of the proximity of their release dates, the two series shared a press junket Jan. 13 in New York in conjunction with The Night Agent’s planned premiere, which featured two actors for The Recruit and five actors and creator Shawn Ryan for The Night Agent.) The Recruit‘ biggest promotional weapon was probably Centineo, who has a huge social media following. It may have helped, though a large part of his followers may be fans of his work in To All the Boys and other rom-coms who wouldn’t necessarily watch The Recruit. It was left largely to the Netflix algorithm to put The Recruit in front of the right viewers, which may not have worked flawlessly. A reader of Deadline’s cancellation story shared in the comments that they had just discovered the show last week and were binging Season 1 and enjoying it when they heard about the cancellation, with the news prompting them to abandon it. Besides the similarities in the genre and protagonist, The Recruit and The Night Agent have something else in common — both are produced by an outside studio, Lionsgate Television and Sony Pictures Television, respectively, on broadcast-type budgets that are more modest than typical Netflix dramas. I hear The Recruit costs around $5M an episode to make after tax breaks, which is very reasonable for a high-end streaming drama. That should’ve made the series a viable renewal proposition even with the viewership drop as Netflix bases its pickup decisions on cost vs. performance (along with creative vision). There is an additional factor. Since Netflix famously pays “cost plus” license fees, a show’s production costs plus a premium of 30%+ of that, a six-episode season of The Recruit would cost 60% that of a comparably budgeted season of The Night Agent, which produces 10 episodes. (Outsized hits like The Night Agent are entitled to additional monetary incentives.) Yet, there doesn’t seem to have been much of deliberation over The Recruit’s future judging by the quick cancellation. Even with the year-to-year drop, The Night Agent‘s Season 2 viewership over the first three weeks was still larger than that for the first three weeks of The Recruit’s first season, which got a renewal, so shows like The Night Agent and Monster, which also was renewed for Season 3 after a Season 2 ratings slide, have enough cushion until the declines become an issue for the Netflix powers that be, especially as series become more expensive after Season 3 with escalating payments under the streamer’s model. Lionsgate TV started producing The Recruit after Season 1, following its acquisition of the series’ original studio, eOne, in December 2023. As an outside studio, Lionsgate TV could theoretically move a show from one platform to another. The  company did it with Minx after it was canceled by Max, finding a new home at corporate sibling Starz. Or getting a Zoey’s Extraordinary Playlist movie on Roku after the series’ cancellation by NBC. Don’t expect that to happen with The Recruit. Netflix has what are arguably the most restrictive licensing terms that include exclusive global rights to the existing seasons for about 10 years and a ban on producers shopping new seasons for 2-3 years after the show’s cancellation by Netflix. The only notable exception has been One Day At a Time, from Sony TV. A shorter moratorium on a linear sale allowed Sony to get a Season 4 pickup by cable network Pop soon after the multi-camera comedy was canceled by Netflix after three seasons. Lionsgate would undoubtedly love to continue The Recruit, which comes from one of its top showrunners in Hawley, creator/executive producer of ABC’s The Rookie, but I hear the studio doesn’t see a path forward without Netflix making major concessions, which is highly unlikely. The only feasible option may be what Hawley floated in his letter to fans after The Recruit’s cancellation. “Is two seasons and a movie a thing?” he wrote. “Cause we’d all be there in a heartbeat.” While considered a very long shot, Netflix ordering a Recruit movie with Centineo, whose early career was built largely by starring in Netflix films, would make sense. While rare, the move wouldn’t be unprecedented — in 2017, Netflix commissioned a Sense8 movie after backlash from fans when the streamer canceled Wachowskis’ sci-fi drama after two seasons. The Recruit‘s second season did not end with a massive cliffhanger like its first season — or Sense8’s second installment — but it left enough storylines open to set up a movie finale.

TITLE: Peter Bart: As Amazon Decides How To Reinvent James Bond, Past 007s May Have Some Ideas
DATE: February 27, 2025 12:30pm
CONTENT:
Will Amazon’s 007 franchise ever take center stage again? Thinking about this, I flashed back to a conversation with an actor friend telling me, “I’ve just been offered a big payday as the next James Bond but I can’t get over the feeling that his every line has been said before – and maybe better.” I was talking with John Gavin who, instead of replacing Sean Connery, opted for a lower salary as Ambassador to Mexico. “Does the world really need another Bond?” he asked. I thought of Gavin this week because his 1983 question is again being bandied about at all-powerful Amazon, which has seized control of the franchise after the 60-year reign of the Broccoli dynasty. Bond has endured 25 iterations grossing a total of $7.8 billion worldwide, with its most recent title three years ago appropriately titled No Time to Die. Jeff Bezos is publicly asking “Who will be the next Bond?” but Gavin had another question: Have Bond movies become somewhat old and British, their sexuality geriatric and their martinis over-stirred?




			Watch on Deadline Coincidentally I’ve personally known almost all of history’s Bond actors and observed them coping with these questions. Roger Moore, always charming, was semi-adept as a tennis partner but felt miscast for mayhem. Pierce Brosnan’s impeccable manners arguably were better attuned to a casino than to combat. Sean Connery admired Barbara Broccoli’s producing skills but urgently resented the way she sliced the profits on merchandise and Bond paraphernalia. Connery once bought me a lavish dinner, asking me to break the news that he had resolutely quit the Bond business to return to the theater. “Is that true?” I asked him. “Of course not, but you’ll help my bargaining position.” He stayed for one more Bond, better paid. Broccoli and her producing partner, her half-brother Michael G, Wilson, fiercely fought off takeover attempts through the years, but their casting and story structures were not consistently as inspired as their negotiating skills. The franchise ran aground in the early ‘80s with the awkwardly titled Octopussy, distributed by United Artists. Perched atop the UA hierarchy at the time, I signed the Octopussy greenlight documents, after first sitting through the obligatory casting debates (a female Bond? a Black Bond?). I knew they were irrelevant because Broccoli had the final call and was bored by studio intervention, as was I. My reason: I knew the dirty little secret that a superior Bond movie, Never Say Never Again, would be shooting at the same period as Octopussy. And that Connery would defect to star in it. Directed by Irvin Kershner, Never was the only Bond movie made by a rival producer (Jack Schwartzman) and, in my view, was exceptionally well-crafted. It starred the dissident Connery, while Octopussy, which was about a Fabergé egg, starred Moore. Connery lobbied for richer and more elaborate personal scenes to display his acting skills, as did Daniel Craig, the most recent Bond. In flirting with his offer, Gavin proposed a less British, more cosmopolitan milieu (his mother was Mexican). The relevant question now, however, is not about casting but business strategy. How will the franchise remain distinctive if it floats amid currents of video games, streamers, theme park rides and immersive gizmos? Hollywood insiders believe the Star Wars legacy has been over exploited by this strategy. “My life has been dedicated to building upon the extraordinary 007 legacy,” said Broccoli in her farewell speech. Broccoli loves the theater and has shown her producing talent, and Wilson is a dedicated art collector and benefactor. Now Broccoli and Wilson will move on and key decisions will lie with Mike Hopkins, Amazon’s head of Prime Video and the MGM studio, who surely has his own road map. “There will be a next phase for the legendary 007 all over the world,” he declared. And bountiful careers await Bond alumni. The never-Bond John Gavin delivered a strong performance as an ambassador. But unlike Connery, he never scored a cut of 007 profits.

TITLE: SXSW 2025: All Of Deadline’s Movie Reviews
DATE: March 9, 2025 9:22am
CONTENT:
The 2025 SXSW Film & TV Festival kicked off Friday, March 7 in Austin with world and North American premieres of movies in 11 sections, TV shows in three sections and several short film and virtual reality programs. This year’s festival kicks off with opening-night film Another Simple Favor reteaming Paul Feig, Blake Lively and Anna Kendrick, with other notable world premiere titles including Chad Hartigan’s The Threesome, Kate Mara‘s two entries The Astronaut and The Dutchman (the latter also starring André Holland), the Ben Affleck-Jon Bernthal sequel The Accountant 2, the Nicole Kidman-starring Holland and Death of a Unicorn starring Paul Rudd and Jenna Ortega. Check out Deadline’s reviews recaps below as films premiere at the fest, which runs through March 15, and click on the titles for the full reviews.




			Watch on Deadline Section: HeadlinerDirector: Gavin O’ConnorCast: Ben Affleck, Jon Bernthal, Cynthia Addai-Robinson, Daniella Pineda, Allison Robertson, J.K. SimmonsDeadline’s takeaway: Nearly a decade after The Accountant, the sequel stands perfectly on its own while delving further into the dynamics that felt halfheartedly introduced the first time around, like Ben Affleck and Jon Bernthal hitting perfect comedic chemistry as estranged brothers who still know how to push each other’s buttons. — GG Section: HeadlinerDirector: Paul FeigCast: Anna Kendrick, Blake Lively, Andrew Rannells, Bashir Salahuddin, Elizabeth Perkins, Michele Morrone, Alex Newell, Henry Golding, Allison Janney Deadline’s takeaway: While some might argue that Feig and writers Jessica Sharzer and Laeta Kalogridis are too reliant on obvious nods to the original film — bringing back familiar plot devices like the mommy vlog teaser opening and an act-three twist that felt a little too recycled — the references ultimately add a playful wink to a fun and exciting film that stands on its own. — GG Section: Narrative SpotlightDirector: Jess VarleyCast: Kate Mara, Laurence Fishburne, Gabriel Luna, Ivana Milicevic, Macy GrayDeadline’s takeaway: Ultimately, The Astronaut doesn’t soar quite as high as some of the better entries in this universe, notably Denis Villeneuve’s Arrival, which I kept thinking about watching this unfold. Its climax just feels a bit rushed and a little incomplete for this to be more than a minor addition to an overly ripe genre. — PH Section: HeadlinerDirector: Alex ScharfmanCast: Jenna Ortega, Paul Rudd, Will Poulter, Richard E. Grant, Anthony Carrigan, Téa Leoni, Jessica Hynes, Sunita Mani, Stephen ParkDeadline’s takeaway: And while the film touches on some serious issues through a humorous lens — like addiction, price-gouging and science deniers — the message felt uneven, hidden beneath a comedy horror that struggles to find its footing, despite its star-studded roster. — GG Section: Narrative SpotlightDirector: Andre GainsCast: André Holland, Kate Mara, Zazie Beetz, Stephen McKinley Henderson, Aldis Hodge, Lauren E. BanksDeadline’s takeaway: Although the symbolism is strong and the underlying themes might seem a little heavy-handed at times, given that the source material was originally written for the stage during a wholly troubling era not unlike our own, that’s forgivable. The film is a dialogue-driven character study that presents as a journey of self-reflection as a nightmarish fever dream. — GG Section: Narrative FeatureDirector: Matthew ShearCast: Amanda Peet, Matthew Shear, Alessandro Nivola, Judd Hirsch, Bob Balaban, Andrea Martin, Zosia Mamet, Jessica Harper, Holland Taylor, Sheng WangDeadline’s takeaway: Shear has crafted a classic kind of family dynamic for this kind of smart, dialogue-driven comedy but he shows a great deal of promise in carefully keeping the inherent drama beneath the surface, particularly involving mental illness and depression, without using any of it as the butt of a joke. These characters and their deep anxieties and life problems feel very real. — PH Section: VisionsDirector: Rodney AscherCast: Jett HarrisDeadline’s takeaway: At an ambitious 95 minutes, Ghost Boy tends to lag in places, but both director and narrator are aware of their story’s potential to get stuck in a groove, and both are there to pick up the slack whenever it’s needed. Like all of Ascher’s films (notably 2021’s A Glitch in the Matrix), it manages to humanize the unthinkable, and its subject will continue to haunt you long after the closing credits. — DW Section: Narrative SpotlightDirector: Ronan CorriganCast: Georgie Farmer, Yasmin Finney, Roman Hayeck-Green, James Scholz, Jessica Reynolds, Charlie Creed-MilesDeadline’s takeaway:  For my money this is hands down the best Screenlife movie yet, a dazzling marriage of online skill, clever storytelling, brilliant editing, and acting within the confines of your computer screen that rivals the best of any heist film in recent years. — PH Section: Narrative SpotlightDirector: Chad HartiganCast: Zoey Deutch, Jonah Hauer-King, Ruby Cruz, Jaboukie Young-White, Josh Segarra, Robert Longstreet, Arden Myrin, Kristin Slaysman, Allan McLeod, Julia SweeneyDeadline’s takeaway: The soap-opera turns The Threesome takes are in the hands of talented indie filmmakers who devise a complex tale of three young singles simply looking for love but find complications pulling them apart and keeping them together in ways they never could have imagined. — PH Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy.
