Releasing Miller will save the Bills $8.5 million in salary cap space. The new deal comes after Garrett requested a trade and Browns owner Jimmy Haslem reportedly refused to meet with the star defensive end. Here's the latest news and everything you need to know about the first major wave of NFL player movement this spring. It's a weak class of free agent tight ends. The position is important, as teams look for their matchup cheat codes like Trey McBride or Brock Bowers. One of the biggest names in free agency is off the market. Teams looking for offensive line help will have options. But Trey Smith and Ronnie Stanley aren't available. “I wouldn’t cross the Raiders off yet,” a high-ranking AFC executive told Yahoo Sports. It reflects a new reality for quarterback-desperate NFL teams — and the resultant white-hot spotlight that's now on Sanders. The Raiders should still be looking for more answers at quarterback. The Raiders have a new starting quarterback, while the Seahawks reportedly plan to target Sam Darnold in free agency. Gallup had a 1,000-yard season among six with the Cowboys, but tore his ACL in 2022 and wasn't the same player. The Cleveland Browns-Myles Garrett relationship isn't getting any warmer. Which quarterbacks might sign to be starters next season? Now that the 2024 season is over and the Philadelphia Eagles have been crowned Super Bowl champs, it’s time to turn our attention to the building blocks of the 2025 season for the entire league. The Raiders haven't had a stable quarterback in several years. They can't go into another season without making a big investment at the position. Is there a team that will take on Kirk Cousins' $180 million contract? The Geno Smith-Pete Carroll reunion opens up a quarterback slot in Seattle, putting Darnold in play for the Seahawks. It's confounding to assess the Seahawks because they have plenty of talent and three straight winning seasons. But there was only one playoff appearance in those three seasons and no postseason wins. Losing Hendrickson could be integral to keeping Ja'Marr Chase and Tee Higgins — and a deeper look at his production could explain the Bengals' approach. Jason Fitz, Frank Schwab and Charles Robinson look ahead to the 2025 NFL Draft’s top story: Shedeur Sanders. There are some veteran receivers and some good defensive line options available. North Carolina's hiring of the former New England Patriots head coach began among United States senators. Who's looking to cash in big and be touted as a key figure in bringing about cultural and on-field change? There are a few solid safeties available in free agency this offseason. The top cornerback in the class was a first-time Pro Bowler last season. Could Zack Baun's deal signal a rebound for linebackers in free agency? Some defensive tackles are among the best free agents in this class. This year's class of edge defenders has contributors but it's probably light on true difference makers. Still, those players will get paid because it has become a premium position in the NFL. There are a few risky veterans available to teams with a receiver need. Last season was a boon for free agent running backs. Yahoo Sports NFL Draft experts Nate Tice and Charles McDonald have combined to deliver the top 50 prospects of this cycle, with intrigue abound. Jacksonville will now pick up a draft pick in exchange for Kirk, who missed most of the 2024 season with a broken collarbone. Hendrickson, who led the league in sacks last season, will now shop around as the Bengals sort out extensions for Ja'Marr Chase and Tee Higgins. Andy Behrens does some NFL offseason wishcasting, pairing available talent with teams that would boost their fantasy value. The Los Angeles Chargers announced Wednesday night that they have released five-time Pro Bowl pass rusher Joey Bosa. Nate Tice and Charles McDonald spent last week at the 2025 NFL combine. Here's their sixth mock draft of this year's cycle. While the finish wasn’t great, the Chargers are in a very good spot this offseason with plenty of resources available to run it back. The former Broncos coach allegedly got into a physical altercation with an officer in the arrivals lane at Denver International Airport. Yahoo Sports NFL Draft expert Charles McDonald checks in with his post-combine big board. He's a classic weakside edge rusher that teams will try to hide against the run. Pearce’s frame and speed-only style gives apprehension about how he will affect the game if he doesn’t win right away. Williams won’t be a true pass rush threat in the NFL, but he can at least help his team get to pass rush downs. Savaiinaea hit 20 miles per hour during his 40-yard dash run and might be able to start at multiple spots along the offensive line. He's another talented player in a deep offensive line class. He might not have a singular standout trait, but Sawyer’s ability to align across the defensive front on any give down will make him an interesting skeleton key-type player for a creative NFL defensive coordinator. He played with some inconsistent QB play in 2024, which hindered some of his progress. He could be a very exciting player if he goes somewhere that can expand his route tree and overall skills. He’ll probably be a guard in the league and projects well to a zone blocking scheme that gets its guys on the move. It’s encouraging Conerly can still win on his blocks despite the inconsistencies because he is such a good athlete. And it must be remembered that he’s on the younger side, too, having turned 21 in November. Barron’s best position will be as a full-time slot defender who can move around the defense for a creative  play-caller at the next level. For the “older” football fans, think Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie. Revel has the ideal size and length of a starting outside cornerback in the NFL. Yahoo Sports NFL Draft expert Nate Tice checks in with his post-combine big board. He’s a smooth mover who should be a lockdown pass protector from Day 1. He may end up being a stash draft pick for a team, but he is dripping with talent and a frame to add more weight and strength. The team did the same for CeeDee Lamb's deal this week, opening up $20 million in cap room

The Saudi regime will fund maternity benefits for more than 320 eligible WTA players. Sometimes a tennis player can be too good for a tournament. Defending Australian Open champion Jannik Sinner topped Alexander Zverev in straight sets, 6-3, 7-6, 5-3 in the 2025 Australian Open final, cementing his third career Grand Slam title. Djokovic could not continue after losing a one-hour, 26-minute first set, 7–6. Madison Keys overwhelmed Iga Swiatek and will now play in her first Australian Open final. Ben Shelton has never been to a Grand Slam final, but he'll have to beat the No. 1 tennis player in the world to get there. Hope for an All-American semifinal was dashed after five-time Grand Slam winner Iga Swiatek beat Emma Navarro on Wednesday. Day 10 was not a great one for the Americans. Keys won her ninth consecutive match, while Rybakina struggled through a back injury. True to form, Novak Djokovic's non-tennis behavior has made headlines. It's an up-and-down day for favorites and the husband-and-wife duo of Gaël Monfils and Elina Svitolina wo their singles matches. Round 3 of the men's and women's singles saw some notable names move on with ease — and others fall. Big names on the men's and women's side advance easily. The top American players just keep on winning. Is Naomi Osaka finally returning to form? Young qualifier Joao Fonesca defeated Andrey Rublev in the biggest upset of Round 1. American Nishesh Basavareddy didn't defeat Novak Djokovic in Round 1, but the 19-year-old impressed the legend by winning the first set. Aryna Sabalenka and Jannik Sinner will try to defend their 2024 titles, but Coco Gauff and Novak Djokovic loom large. Osaka was leading Clara Tauson 6-4 before receiving attention from trainers for her abdomen. Andy Murray will be on the same side of the net as his former rival Novak Djokovic. Rafael Nadal lost what could be the final match of his career before retirement, but there's no shame in that. Rafael Nadal is calling it a career. Jimmy Pinoargote penalized Tiafoe for a time violation during a third-set tiebreak near the end of a hard-fought match. King also became the sixth athlete to win both the Presidential Medal of Freedom and the Congressional Gold Medal. Jannik Sinner defeated Taylor Fritz in straight sets to win the 2024 US Open, earning his second Grand Slam title of the year. Sabalenka made the finals at the US Open last year and has won the last two Australian Open singles titles For the first time since 2006, an American man will play for the title at Arthur Ashe Stadium. Taylor Fritz will face Jannik Sinner on Sunday. Can Jessica Pegula finish her run with an upset of Aryna Sabalenka to win the US Open? Half of the semifinal field is comprised of U.S. players after Pegula secured the fourth quarterfinal win by an American. Navarro won the last six games of the match. She was the first of three Americans in quarterfinal play at the US Open on Tuesday. An American man will play in the final of a Grand Slam for the first time since 2009. Jessica Pegula and Iga Swiatek both advanced to the quarterfinals on the women's side on Monday. American Taylor Fritz has advanced to the US Open quarterfinals for the second consecutive year, avenging a loss to Casper Ruud at the French Open. Emma Navarro has now beaten Coco Gauff two straight times after her victory at Wimbledon earlier this summer. After a week of chaos, Jannik Sinner didn't even allow a break point. This is the first year Djokovic didn't win a Grand Slam since 2017. The veteran took the All-American rematch at the US Open. Coco Gauff advanced to the fourth round of the US Open on Friday, moving closer to defending her title. Alcaraz went down in straight sets to the No. 74 player in the world. After an impressive first-round upset over Jelena Ostapenko, Naomi Osaka fell to Karolina Muchova in straight sets in the US Open second round. This marks the seventh time this year that the 25-year-old from Kazakhstan has withdrawn from competition due to illness or injury. Gauff and Djokovic both faced early tests. The US Open will remain on ESPN for the foreseeable future, at no small expense. Alcaraz won 10 of the last 11 games. Naomi Osaka hasn't reached the quarterfinal of a Grand Slam since she won the 2021 Australian Open. Novak Djokovic is fresh off his gold medal win at the Paris Olympics earlier this summer. The 2017 champion, Stephens lost an opening-round thriller that featured six breaks in the decisive third set. Will we see the 2023 winners defend their trophies? Jannik Sinner will now get to head into the U.S. Open with his steroid scandal behind him. Alcaraz was knocked out in the second round of the Cincinnati Open by Gaël Monfils in three sets.

LeBron James exited Saturday's much-anticipated rivalry clash between the Los Angeles Lakers and Boston Celtics with a groin strain. Midway through the fourth quarter, the 40-year-old left for the locker room and was soon announced to be ruled out for the rest of the game. He ended his night with 22 points, 14 rebounds and nine assists, with the Lakers going on to lose 111-101. The injury appeared to occur while James made a few pivot moves in the game. He proceeded to signal to be taken out after the following defensive possession, then didn't return after testing it during a timeout. This is the play that LeBron seemed to be injured on. He left after the next possession Based on the overstretch on the pivot I’m worried about his left adductor (groin) pic.twitter.com/p7fG0Twr10 — Dr. Evan Jeffries, DPT (@GameInjuryDoc) March 9, 2025 Lakers head coach JJ Redick didn't have any additional details after the game, but conceded there was "obvious concern" about James' health. ESPN's Dave McMenamin also reported the initial thought is James will be out weeks rather than days. However, James didn't seem to think the injury was that serious afterward. Yet he acknowledged that consulting with trainer Mike Mancias for more tests and imaging was necessary. "Not much concern," James said to reporters. "Obviously, we'll go day-to-day and look at it each day and see if it gets better and then take the proper measures and see what we need to do moving forward." LeBron on his groin injury: "Not much concern...Obviously we'll go day-to-day and look at it each day and see if it gets better and then take the proper measures and see what we need to do moving forward." pic.twitter.com/uwHuxxZBaH — Spectrum SportsNet (@SpectrumSN) March 9, 2025 James added that this injury didn't feel as serious as the groin injury he suffered in 2018 on Christmas Day, which occurred against the Golden State Warriors. That strain sidelined him for 17 games and lingered through the rest of that season. "Ive been there before and know what type of injury we're dealing with," he explained and said that he expects to stay with the Lakers through the remaining three games of their road trip. The injury and the loss put a halt to what had been a dream stretch for the Lakers, who entered Saturday with an eight-game win streak after their league-shaking trade for Dončić. The move also seemed to energize James, who went from averaging 24 points per game before the trade to 28.5 in the games since. A significant James injury would obviously be a blow for the Lakers, who just started a road trip that will also see them face the Milwaukee Bucks and Denver Nuggets. It would also put more pressure on Dončić to lead a team he joined a month ago. James has only missed four games so far this season and entered Saturday on track for his most games played in a season since he played all 82 in 2017-18.

Jokić's 30-20-20 game cut Gilgeous-Alexander's lead in the MVP odds. Can anyone surpass Cam Ward to be the 1st pick of the NFL Draft? The Cleveland Cavaliers are the No. 3 favorite at +800. The NFL hasn't had consecutive back-to-back Super Bowl champions in 50 years. The Super Bowl is a sports betting holiday every year. The spread has stayed steady in the days leading up to Super Bowl LIX. There has been a slight movement on the total for Super Bowl LIX. What are the most popular props for Super Bowl LIX? Over the course of 58 Super Bowls, 64% of teams wearing white have gone on to win. The Commanders are 6-point underdogs at the Eagles and the Bills are 2-point underdogs at the Chiefs. There's a new name linked to the Cowboys' head coaching search. The three other favorites are getting the majority of money against the spread. The Cowboys have an opening after parting ways with Mike McCarthy this week. Buffalo has never been a home underdog in a playoff game. The Rams are the only home team not favored in the remaining four wild-card games. Patrick Surtain II is vying to be the seventh cornerback to win DPOY. Here's a look at Week 17 of the NFL season from a betting perspective. The NFL MVP race might come down to the end of the season. Here's a look at Week 16 of the NFL season from a betting perspective. The Bills have also passed the Chiefs as the favorites in the AFC. Here's a look at Week 15 of the NFL season from a betting perspective. Josh Allen is closing in on his first career NFL MVP award. Packers-Lions is one of the marquee games on the Week 14 schedule. Here's a look at Week 13 of the NFL season from a betting perspective. Conor Benn got some long-awaited good news on Wednesday, but the saga of his 2022 doping violations may not be over yet. Jayden Daniels might have a case to be the MVP of the NFL right now. Here's a look at Week 5 of the NFL season from a betting perspective. Here's a preview of Week 3 in the NFL season from a betting perspective. Favorites ruled in Week 1 of the NFL season. Let's preview Week 1 from a betting perspective. Colorado was bettors' favorite team over the 2023 season. Just four teams have odds better than 15-1 to win the first 12-team College Football Playoff. City could be punished during the 2024-25 season with a points deduction for its alleged breaches of financial rules. The Lions should be a good team, and that matters to the MVP race. BetMGM's odds for the NBA title had a big change on Monday morning. Zaccharie Risacher is the latest player to lead the odds to be selected first in the NBA Draft. Not too long ago, the Panthers were an overwhelming favorite to win it all. The Buffs have seven games against teams that made bowl games in 2023 along with visits to Nebraska and Colorado State. The MVP favorite spot moved from one Dodger to another. Bettors love the Panthers to go over their win total this season. England hasn't won a major men's soccer tournament since 1966. Scheffler has five wins so far in 2024 and has been the big favorite ahead of all three majors. The Celtics haven't been underdogs in the playoffs yet. The Buffaloes' preseason win total sits at 5.5. They're getting the most bets of any college football team on either side of that number. Ohio State is right behind Georgia among national title favorites thanks to all the action on the Buckeyes. It'll be a surprise if anyone other than Tatum, Dončić, Jaylen Brown or Kyrie Irving wins Finals MVP. Beck and Ewers will square off in Week 8 when Georgia visits Texas. The Celtics opened the season as co-favorites with the Milwaukee Bucks at +400. The Bears are one of the more interesting NFL teams going into the season. The co-leader in bets for the No. 1 overall pick is a stunner.

Bernard Muir took over at Stanford for Bob Bowlsby in 2012. Notre Dame went into Monday's game against Duke ranked as the nation's No. 1 team for the first time this season. It looked very much the part while dominating one of the nation's better teams. Three of the five top teams in the Associated Press Top 25 lost last week, clearing the table for a restructuring. Following up their big win over South Carolina, the No. 3 Longhorns had no letdown versus No. 8 Kentucky. The Notre Dame star was two assists from a triple-double. Prince Harry created the Invictus Games Foundation and is being given the Pat Tillman Award for service. Auriemma will remain with UConn through an unprecedented period of growth for women's basketball amid a dramatically changing landscape across college sports. Bluder coached Iowa for 24 years. She's retired at the conclusion of the Caitlin Clark era. Tara VanDerveer retired last month as the winningest head coach in men’s and women’s Division-I college basketball. Former Oregon State star Raegan Beers announced her transfer to Oklahoma. She was the Beavers' leading scorer last season as the team advanced to the NCAA Tournament's Elite Eight. The addition of von Oelhoffen further strengthens a Trojans roster that projects to compete for a national championship. The longtime Stanford assistant and former player will take over for a coaching legend. Tara VanDerveer racked up an NCAA record 1,216 wins throughout her 45 seasons coaching in college basketball. Kim Caldwell is embracing the high expectation as the new women's basketball coach at Tennessee. Her contract would make her the highest-paid coach in the sport if she were to win a national championship. Despite a record-breaking first quarter, Caitlin Clark and Iowa couldn't get past the Gamecocks on Sunday afternoon. Tennessee hired Kim Caldwell as their next women's basketball coach. Caldwell previously coached at Marshall and Division II Glenville State. The Madness is nearing its conclusion. After two weeks of basketball, there are two teams left. The Gamecocks are headed to the title game. This was supposed to be a rebuilding year for Dawn Staley's program. Instead, the Gamecocks are undefeated, and this might be her best team yet. It’s the final weekend of the college basketball season and the two best point guards in the class of 2020 are not only still playing, but will face off against each other. Caitlin Clark won National Player of the Year again, and South Carolina's Dawn Staley won Coach of the Year for the third straight season. It's possible the first two rounds will no longer be held at campus sites of highly-ranked teams. 2024 is the first time that two schools have both teams in the Final Four in the same season. Everything is over the top in Louisiana, and this LSU team is a good representation of that. The locals embrace all the personalities the same and take pride in who they are and what they represent. UConn is headed to the Final Four for the 23rd time in program history. Tennessee has fired women's basketball coach Kellie Harper after five seasons. The Lady Vols did not advance past the Sweet 16 during her tenure. Four Final Four tickets were punched on Sunday. The Gamecocks have had some close calls in their charge back to the Final Four. But a familiar face has helped them reset when things get dicey. After being picked to finish 10th in the Pac-12, the Beavers blew away expectations by making a run to the Elite Eight and competing with No. 1 South Carolina to the end. Can the UConn women join the men in the Final Four? The Tigers will face Iowa on Monday in a rematch of last year's national championship game. Indiana cut a 22-point South Carolina lead to two points. When a 22-point lead nearly vanished in the closing minutes against Indiana, it took a team effort to gut out the victory. This is how the Gamecocks play ball. Clark is a natural in the spotlight, but coach Lisa Bluder's deference to the superstar makes Iowa's situation more unique than most as the women's game grows bigger than ever. The last remaining perfect entry in Yahoo's women's bracket challenge was eliminated with Oregon State's 70-65 win over Notre Dame. The Gamecocks are looking dominant, but coach Dawn Staley wasn't exactly oozing with confidence after the SEC tournament. It’s rather common to hear women’s basketball players grew up without watching the game they aspired to play at the highest level. But that's changing, and the extra exposure should have a huge impact on the next generation. Clark and Bueckers have been the centers of attention since stepping foot on their respective campuses. They may have to go through each other to win it all this year. Now that we're down to the final 16, let's take another look at every team from most to least likely to take home a national championship. Caitlin Clark dropped 32 points to lead the Hawkeyes to a 64-54 win over West Virginia on Monday night in Iowa City. Multiple scoring records fell on Monday as the last of the Sweet 16 tickets were punched. Bueckers is back leading the Huskies into the Sweet 16 after two career-altering injuries. We finally got a couple of upsets on Sunday, while a near-upset produced the best game of the day at Stanford. And the title favorite did what it was supposed to. Bueckers is back. Day 2 of the NCAA women's tournament was dominated by top seeds. Katie Meier was first hired at Miami in 2005, and she led the program to 10 NCAA tournament appearances. From a first-time tournament team to a prolific scorer, here is everything you need to know about the region before March Madness begins. The road to a championship once again goes through undefeated South Carolina, which secured its second consecutive No. 1 overall seed. Selection Sunday is here. South Carolina is a better-than-even-money favorite to win the national title again.

All is well again between Myles Garrett and the Cleveland Browns. The two sides have agreed on a contract extension that will pay the defensive end an average annual salary of $40 million and includes $123.5 million in guaranteed money, ESPN's Adam Schefter reported. With the extension, Garrett will now be the highest-paid non-quarterback in NFL history. The new contract ends a five-week saga during which Garrett requested a trade, saying he wanted to win a Super Bowl rather than be part of a rebuilding project. The Browns attempted to start talks on a contract extension, but Garrett cut off negotiations following his trade request. From trade to truce and beyond: the Browns and Myles Garrett reached agreement today on a record contract extension that averages $40 million per year and includes $123.5 million in guaranteed money and now makes him the highest-paid non-QB in NFL history, sources tell ESPN.… pic.twitter.com/scNWJH2vFX — Adam Schefter (@AdamSchefter) March 9, 2025 Browns general manager Andrew Berry repeatedly said that the team had no interest in trading Garrett and wanted to extend his contract. Team owner Jimmy Haslem refused to meet with the 2023 NFL Defensive Player of the Year when Garrett wanted to discuss his future with the Browns. Obviously, something changed between the two sides. Garrett, 29, finished second in the NFL with 14 sacks last season, his fifth consecutive season with 12 or more sacks. Additionally, he had 47 total tackles, 22 tackles for loss, 28 quarterback hits and 83 total pressures, playing in all 17 of the Browns games. He was named first-team All-Pro for the second straight year and fourth time in the past five years, along with earning Pro Bowl honors for the fifth consecutive season. Garrett was the No. 1 overall pick by the Browns in 2017 out of Texas A&M. In his eight NFL seasons, he's compiled 102.5 sacks and 352 total tackles in 117 games (114 starts). However, Cleveland finished 3-14 last season and doesn't appear in position to improve much from that in the near future as the team attempts to solve its quarterback dilemma while attempting to fix the stranglehold that Deshaun Watson's contract has on its salary cap. The Browns go into the offseason with only $4.3 million in cap space, according to Spotrac, which doesn't leave much room to make key additions.

North Carolina State has fired men's basketball coach Kevin Keatts. The school announced the dismissal on Sunday morning, one season after the Wolfpack advanced to the Final Four. "I want to thank Coach Keatts for his contributions to NC State and for always representing the university with class," athletic director Boo Corrigan said in a statement. "He will always have a treasured place in Wolfpack history for the accomplishments of his 2023-24 squad and I appreciate the passion he brought to this role. We wish him and his family the best in the future." Corrigan added that a national search for a new head coach would begin immediately. Keatts compiled a record 158-113 (69-84 in ACC play) at NC State, which included five 20-win seasons and three NCAA tournament bids. Last season, the Wolfpack won the ACC tournament championship and advanced to the NCAA Final Four as a No. 11 seed by beating conference and in-state rival Duke. Survive. And. Advance. 👏For the first time since 1983, NC State is back in the #MFinalFour 🐺 #MarchMadness @PackMensBball pic.twitter.com/oAN40ASil7 — NCAA March Madness (@MarchMadnessMBB) April 4, 2024 However, NC State slid considerably this season after stars DJ Horne and DJ Burns Jr. moved on, finishing 5-15 in the ACC and 13-19 overall, failing to qualify for the ACC tournament after winning it the previous year. The 2024 Final Four run triggered a two-year contract extension for Keatts through the 2029-30 season. But NC State ended up buying him out for $8 million just under a year later. Keatts responded to the decision on social media, saying that he is "officially entering the portal." pic.twitter.com/0RR2DRBv7T — Kevin Keatts (@CoachKeattsNCSU) March 9, 2025 “I am extremely proud of what we accomplished during my time here," Keatts wrote in his statement. "Prior to my first season, the NCAA informed us that we were being investigated due to the actions of the prior staff. "We were able to guide the program through five years of investigations and penalties and came out on the other side with back-to-back NCAA tournament appearances, and for the first time in 37 and 40 years, an ACC Championship and a trip to the Final Four.” Before coming to Raleigh, Keatts coached at UNC Wilmington for three seasons, winning two Colonial Athletic Association tournament championships and earning two NCAA tournament bids. Upon taking over at NC State, he faced recruiting violations tied to previous coach Mark Gottfried that resulted in the program being placed on probation for one year in December 2021. NC State is the fourth ACC men's basketball program to make a coaching change during the 2024-25 season, joining Virginia, Florida State and Miami.

UConn and coach Dan Hurley's quest to win a third consecutive NCAA championship will be covered with a behind-the-scenes look Sunday on CBS' "60 Minutes" with a fitting segment name for college basketball's most quirky coach: "A Method to his Madness." The segment will provide a look at the Huskies' bid to three-peat with insight from Hurley as he and his Huskies forge into March after winning back-to-back national titles. The show will air at 7 p.m. ET on CBS. Among the topics discussed include his maniacal preparation for games, managing a changing roster and an introspective look back at a viral moment earlier this season in which he yelled at an official for turning his back on him because he is the "best coach in the f------ sport." "I'm complex," Hurley says in the interview with CBS correspondent Jon Wertheim. "Now listen, I had no idea that -- if I knew the camera was on me, there's no way I woulda said it. But I'm embarrassed." A post shared by 60 Minutes (@60minutes) The interview with Hurley also includes a sit-down with his wife, Andrea, who has been an instrumental piece not just in Hurley's life, but also in UConn's rise to the top of the sport. Andrea and Dan debated, and ultimately rejected, advances from the Los Angeles Lakers last summer to remain at UConn. Matt Norlander spoke with Andrea last fall and said the decision to return to UConn was spurred at least in part by an intense desire to chase history with a potential three-peat at stake. That desire oozes into every part of his life on and off the floor as detailed in depth in the "60 Minutes" segment. UConn is chasing history not seen since John Wooden's UCLA Bruins with a chance to win three consecutive national championships in men's college basketball. UConn is 21-9 on the season leading into the weekend and a projected No. 8 seed in Jerry Palm's latest bracket.

Omaha won't be playing for the Summit League Conference Tournament title until Sunday, but the Mavericks assured themselves of a spot in the 2025 NCAA Tournament late Saturday night. Omaha's opponent in the Summit League Tournament final is No. 2 seed St. Thomas, which is in the final year of its four-year transition period from Division III to Division I. Due to NCAA rules, the Tommies won't be eligible for the NCAA Tournament until next season, thus clearing the path for Omaha to make its first-ever Big Dance appearance regardless of what happens in the tournament title game. Earlier Saturday SIU Edwardsville clinched the first automatic bid to the NCAA Tournament, as the No. 2 seed Cougars toppled No. 1 seed Southeast Missouri State in the Ohio Valley Conference Tournament championship game. It is SIUE's first appearance in the Big Dance during its 17 years at the Division I level. Southeast Missouri State was seeking to make its second NCAA Tournament appearance of the past three seasons after winning both meetings with SIUE en route to a regular-season title. But the Redhawks couldn't overcome an abysmal shooting night as they finished just 3 of 24 from beyond the arc. Ray'Sean Taylor led SIUE with 20 points as he became the program's all-time scoring leader during the game. He hit 13 of 16 free throws, led the Cougars with four assists and tied a team-high with seven rebounds. The Missouri Valley Conference Tournament champion will be crowned Sunday when No. 1 seed Drake and No. 2 seed Bradley square off with a spot in the NCAA Tournament on the line. The teams split their regular season series and will be settling the score with a high-stakes showdown on CBS. Both had to overcome double-digit deficits in the semifinals to reach this point. Drake trailed No. 4 seed Belmont by 12 before roaring back with a 36-20 edge in the second half to beat the Bruins 57-50. Bradley rallied from an 11-point deficit to edge No. 11 seed Valparaiso 70-65. Elsewhere, No. 1 seed High Point will take on No. 3 seed Winthrop in the Big South Tournament final, and No. 1 seed Lipscomb will host No. 2 seed North Alabama in the ASUN Tournament title game. The Summit League will also crown a tournament champion Sunday as the postseason continues heating up. SportsLine conference tournament odds, picks: Proven experts share best bets for every tourney

TITLE: LeBron James injury: How the Lakers can survive the next few weeks without the face of the league

Take a deep breath, Laker fans. I know it feels like the sky is falling right now. LeBron James suffered a strained groin on Saturday, against the hated Boston Celtics no less, and now he's expected to miss at least the next 1-2 weeks. Given his age and where we are on the schedule, it would be easy to overreact about what this means for his health moving forward. Let's go back just two years, to 2023. The season was, in many ways, similar to this one. A slow start led to a trade deadline revamp. The Lakers raced out of the gates, winning the first three games that James played with the new, post-Russell Westbrook roster by 34 combined points. But in that third game, on Feb. 26 against the Mavericks, James suffered a right foot injury that sidelined him for exactly one month. He played in the final eight games of the regular season, and that was ultimately enough. The Lakers made it all the way to the Western Conference finals. As his brief partnership with Luka Dončić thus far has suggested, there's not going to be much more of an acclimation period. The two are ready to win together. All that matters, at this point, is that James is ready to go by the middle of April. If he is, the Lakers should be fine, perhaps not Western Conference favorites, but still one of the most dangerous teams in the field overall. The broader question now is what happens while he's out. The answer, probably, is some degree of short-term pain. The Lakers hold the No. 3 seed in the Western Conference by only 1.5 games over the Memphis Grizzlies and two games over the Houston Rockets. Their five-game lead over the Golden State Warriors is probably safe, but that will rely on health elsewhere. The Lakers have the sixth-hardest remaining schedule in the NBA, including one head-to-head matchup each with Memphis and Golden State and two with Houston. None of those games, however, come until March 29, so there is a good chance that James is back in time to play in them. There are pros and cons to slipping outside of the top three, if that is how this plays out. The obvious danger is that it means an earlier matchup with the No. 1-seeded Oklahoma City Thunder, who are having one of the best statistical seasons in NBA history. Of course, after Dončić dispatched them in the second round of the postseason a year ago, the Lakers might not fear them all that much. The obvious benefit, in all likelihood, is that it makes a first-round matchup with Stephen Curry, Jimmy Butler and the similarly reloaded Golden State Warriors less likely. As hot as the Warriors are right now, a three-game lead with fewer than 20 to play is substantial. Golden State's likeliest slot is No. 6, which means getting out of No. 3 helps avoid them. Don't let records fool you. There isn't a team in the NBA that would rather see Curry and Butler than an inexperienced Rockets group in the first round. For now, the idea will be to adjust to life without James, and the Lakers are fortunately better equipped to do that than most teams would be. Dončić, obviously, has no shortage of experience when it comes to leading an offense singlehandedly, and Austin Reaves has quietly been excellent when James has missed time. Over the last two seasons, he has averaged 21.7 points, 6.1 assists and 5.1 rebounds across the 14 games he has played without James. Ball-handling, thankfully, is not an issue. If Rui Hachimura can make it back before James does (which appears likely), then all the better. As offense-centric as a roster built around Dončić, James and Reaves figured to be, the Lakers haven't actually won with offense since their blockbuster trade. In the 12 games since Dončić debuted in purple and gold, the Lakers rank No. 15 on offense and No. 2 on defense. Maintaining average offense with Dončić and Reaves soaking up more possessions seems doable. That's especially true given the regression they're likely to experience. Since Dončić arrived, they've shot only 36% on wide-open 3s and 32.4% on open 3s. The former would be a bottom-five shooting mark in the NBA and the latter would be bottom 10. The Lakers shot multiple percentage points better before Dončić arrived, but have better shooting on-paper with him. There's room for offensive growth here through regression alone. The flip side to this is that the Lakers have also been remarkably lucky when it comes to opponent shooting. Teams facing the Lakers post-Dončić's debut are shooting 34.4% on wide-open 3s and 30.3% on open ones. That shooting luck defensively is probably more important in the grand scheme of things because of the roster the Lakers are currently playing with. Remember, the Lakers ultimately didn't land a center at the deadline after nixing the Mark Williams trade. Jaxson Hayes has held up as well as could be expected since then, but he's only playing around half of the game. Two-way center Trey Jemison has impressed in a backup role as well, but there is not a traditional defensive anchor here. The Lakers are thriving defensively because of their effort, their basketball IQ and their size and athleticism on the wing. Losing James, who has been stellar defensively of late, is a big blow there. Jarred Vanderbilt, Dorian Finney-Smith and Gabe Vincent have all been quite good defensively, but all play substantially less than James does and lack his near-encyclopedic knowledge of essentially any action any offense has run over the past two decades. Losing James means losing another rangy wing and putting more of a defensive strain on Dončić and Reaves when their offensive roles just got more difficult. The name of the game right now, especially without consistently elite rim-protection, is probably going to be turnover generation. The Lakers have improved markedly on this front as the season has progressed, jumping from 20th to 12th since Dončić first suited up for them. The Lakers have played very aggressively defensively without Anthony Davis, and that's going to have to persist now that James is sidelined. They are fortunately a pretty athletic bunch, and JJ Redick has proven malleable when it comes to game-planning. As promising as a James-Dončić partnership looked on paper, the Lakers surely understood that the bulk of Dončić's work as a Laker would likely come after James retired. Now, they'll get their first peek at what a fully Dončić-centric lineup could eventually look like. That's not the worst thing. It could prove to be a valuable data point they use in tweaking the roster this summer, or even further down the line. How viable is a Dončić-Reaves duo as the core of a roster? As confident as the Lakers are in Reaves' future, they probably need to figure out relatively soon if he's going to be good enough to serve as Dončić's sidekick after James is gone. In a few weeks, they'll be closer to an answer. The Lakers were the hottest team in the NBA when James got hurt. Recapturing the magic of the last few weeks when he returns won't be easy, but they have proof of concept at least. If James is healthy by the playoffs, they believe they can play with anyone. As frustrating as this injury is, there is at least hope that he will be ready when it counts.

A spot in the 2025 NCAA Tournament will be on the line on Sunday on CBS and Paramount+ when the Drake Bulldogs take on the Bradley Braves in the 2025 Missouri Valley Conference Tournament championship game. Drake is 29-3 on the season and won the MVC regular-season title with a 17-3 record. Bradley earned the No. 2 seed after a 26-7 season where the Braves went 15-5 in conference play. This will be the second time in three years these two teams have met in the MVC Tournament final and it's Drake's fifth championship game appearance in a row. Tipoff is set for 2:15 p.m. ET at the Enterprise Center in St. Louis. The latest Drake vs. Bradley odds from SportsLine consensus list the Bulldogs as 4-point favorites, while the over/under for total points scored is 118.5. Drake is the -192 favorite on the money line, while Bradley is a +159 underdog. You can watch this matchup on CBS and Paramount+, where you can get a seven-day free trial right here.

While his former team continues to search for Ben Roethlisberger's long-term successor, Pittsburgh Steelers legend Hines Ward recently compared an up-and-coming college quarterback to Big Ben, his quarterback during eight of his 14 seasons in Pittsburgh. Ward, who is currently serving as Arizona State's receivers coach, recently said that Sun Devils quarterback Sam Leavitt reminds him of Roethlisberger, a two-time Super Bowl champion and future Hall of Famer. A sophomore transfer from Michigan State, Leavitt helped lead Arizona State to a Big 12 championship and a birth in the expanded College Football Playoff during his first year as the school's starting quarterback. "And a coach that's on the sideline, I can tell you, when (there's a) TV timeout, when we're all on the sideline, Sam has that look in his eyes, like, 'We will not be stopped. We're going to score,'" Ward recently said of Leavitt. "He wants to score each and every time he touches a football. And he had that same look that Ben Roethlisberger had. Anytime I looked at Ben and his eyes, I just knew we were going to win the game because he had that look. He was not going to be denied of us winning. So I see a little bit of Ben in Sam in that aspect, just watching him and his approach, because he's very competitive." Ward said that Leavitt is so competitive that he sometimes struggles to give up on a play. That was a challenge Roethlisberger also dealt with during his early years in Pittsburgh. "He wants to make every play instead of throwing it out of bounds," Ward said. "Ben had that same struggle. He just wanted to make every play, he wanted to make sure he can try to do all that he can to make the play. Sam has those intangibles." He's not as big as Roethlisberger, but the 6-foot-2, 200-pound Leavitt has a similar play style. While not a run-first QB, Leavitt is not afraid to take off downfield even if it means taking a lick from multiple defenders. Leavitt is also skilled at making throws on the run (something Roethlisberger routinely did early in his career) while giving his receivers chances to make plays. Is Sam Leavitt a sleeper for first overall pick in the 2026 Draft? 🔱🤔His performance against Iowa State in the @Big12Conference Championship game was SPECIAL 🔥@SSN_SunDevils X @SunDevilDaily  pic.twitter.com/kDIJ3vsADT Leavitt also has budding leadership skills that remind Ward of the Steelers' former quarterback. "He's taking it to another level, being more of a vocal leader, understanding that this is his team, and he wants to lead by example," Ward said. "He's the first guy out there. If you mess up or you run the wrong route, he will get on you. That's what you want. You want that commanding enforcement from your quarterback, understanding that this is the level that I expect everybody to be on. ... I love it, and our guys are starting to respond to it. "He has that killer look in him, that we will not fail with Sam being in that huddle. That's what I love about him." While Ward would probably love it if they could, the Steelers can't draft Leavitt next month as he is a year away from being eligible for the draft. But if Pittsburgh is in a similar spot this time a year from now, it's safe to assume the franchise will at least take a look at a player that Ward speaks so highly of.

Steph Curry reached another major milestone in his historic career on Saturday when he joined the 25,000-point club during the Golden State Warriors' thrilling 115-110 victory over the Detroit Pistons. Curry hit the mark early in the third quarter when he buried a 3-pointer thanks to a screen from his long-time teammate, Draymond Green. Curry didn't have his best shooting night, but he got to the free throw line time and again en route to 32 points, 13 of which came in the fourth quarter as the Warriors held off the Pistons for their fourth win in a row. With that victory, they moved into sixth place in the Western Conference. "It's stunning. It's night after night," Warriors coach Steve Kerr said. "He was brilliant on a night where his shot really wasn't there." Curry is the 26th player in NBA history to reach 25,000 points and the 10th to do so with one team. The other members of that exclusive club are Karl Malone (Jazz), Kobe Bryant (Lakers), Dirk Nowitzki (Mavericks), Michael Jordan (Bulls), Hakeem Olajuwon (Rockets), Tim Duncan (Spurs), John Havlicek (Celtics), Reggie Miller (Pacers) and Jerry West (Lakers). 25K POINTS FOR STEPH CURRY 🙌Fitting it comes on a tough turnaround three! pic.twitter.com/2j6nRgR4XA After Saturday's contest, Curry now has 25,017 points, which ranks 26th on the NBA's all-time scoring list. Perhaps the biggest question coming out of this game, at least from an individual perspective with Curry, is how high he can climb. Let's break it down by the next big milestones. Here's a look at 25-19: 25th Jerry West 25,192 24th Reggie Miller 25,279 23rd Alex English 25,613 22nd Vince Carter 25,728 21st Russell Westbrook 25,935 20th Kevin Garnett 26,071 Curry is 1,054 points behind Garnett, so he'll easily pass him at some point next season assuming he stays even somewhat healthy (for reference, Curry scored 1,956 points in 74 games last season). Of course, Westbrook is still active and will surpass Garnett first, so Curry will have to pass Havlicek to jump into the top 20. To do that he'll need 1,379 points, which should also be no trouble. What about the top 15? Here is what 18-15 looks like at this moment: 18th Paul Pierce 26,397 17th Tim Duncan 26,496 16th Dominique Wilkins 26,668 15th Oscar Robertson 26,710 This is a tightly-bunched group and all of them are retired so we don't need to worry about the margin changing. Curry needs to score 1,694 points to pass Robertson and move into the top 15. Again, that should be a lock, and is even within reach next season as long as Curry doesn't have a lengthy absence (Curry is doubling up Westbrook's scoring average this season, and even with Westbrook's advantage he has a good chance to get to Robertson before him.) Assuming Curry eventually moves into the top 15, the top 10 then moves into sight. That is one of the most exclusive clubs in the sport, and getting there will be no easy feat, even for someone as talented as Curry. 14th Hakeem Olajuwon 26,946 13th James Harden 27,213 12th Elvin Hayes 27,313 11th Moses Malone 27,049 10th Carmelo Anthony 28,289 9th Shaquille O'Neal 28,596 James Harden is more than 2,000 points ahead of Curry and still active. Harden should get into the top 10 himself -- perhaps by next season -- and it's extremely unlikely Curry will ever catch Harden. So that means Curry will have to also pass O'Neal to get into the top 10. Curry is 3,580 points behind O'Neal, and this is where it starts to get interesting. While Curry has had some huge games lately, he doesn't score at the same level he did in his prime, or even a few years ago. This season he's averaging 24.4 points per game, which is his lowest mark for a full season since 2015. Injuries are also a concern as he ages. The Warriors have 18 games remaining this season. If Curry keeps up his current rate and plays 15 games (allowing for a few days off) he should add another 350-375 points this season. It's unclear how long Curry, who turns 37 on March 12, will want to play. Allowing for a further small decrease in the scoring department and possible injuries, but no major ones, let's try to figure out a range of outcomes for Curry in the next two seasons. The high end for Curry might be about 3,266 more points from now until the end of the 2027 campaign; the low end could be about 2,425. Again, we're doing a lot of guesswork here, but it's very possible that Curry would have to play into the 2027-28 season, when he would turn 40, in order to catch O'Neal and enter the top 10 on the all-time scoring list. Is that possible? Absolutely. Curry is very well conditioned and one of the league's ultimate competitors. Would he want to? Probably. It's hard to imagine a scenario where Curry retires a few hundred points shy of becoming a top 10 scorer ever. Is anyone else within reach? And what about 30,000 points? Here's 8-5 on the all-time list: 8th Kevin Durant 30,269 7th Wilt Chamberlain 31,419 6th Dirk Nowitzki 31,560 Durant is currently eighth, and he's still racking up points. Chamberlain, meanwhile, is more than 6,000 points ahead of Curry. You don't want to say anything is impossible, but it's hard to imagine a world where Curry ever climbs higher than 10th on the all-time list. Getting to 30,000 is also asking a lot. Ultimately the safest bet is that Curry will finish somewhere between 15th and 10th on the all-time scoring list when he retires. Not bad for someone who played three years of college and didn't average 20 points per game until his fourth professional season.

20 days until Opening Day ... You don't want to totally change your opinion about players based on what happens in Spring Training, but you also don't want to just stick your head in the sand and avoid all new information. The whole point of these Friday newsletters is to try to differentiate between the noise of Spring Training and the stuff that might actually matter, after all. And one specific performance on Thursday does have me reconsidering my opinion on one specific player: Shane McClanahan. McClanahan is coming back from Tommy John surgery, and I just couldn't bring myself to rank him as much more than just a mid-round upside flier sight unseen. I've been ranking him behind his ADP (124.5) since I first put my rankings together, but after watching his start against the Phillies Thursday, I'm rethinking that. Because he looked really good. The four strikeouts and one walk over 2.2 innings tell some of the story, of course, but results really aren't what we care about in the spring. We care about the process, and McClanahan more or less passed with flying colors there, too. He averaged 96.2 mph with his fastball, and his velocity got a little better as the outing went on, too – he averaged 95.7 mph in the first inning, but had that up to 96.7 in the second and third innings. And the other physical characteristics of the pitch mostly looked to be in line with where he was prior to the injury, too. And it wasn't just the fastball. His changeup looked sharp, generating four whiffs on seven swings, including several ugly chases. He added three more whiffs on his slider, with the curveball being the only pitch he didn't get any whiffs on over six attempts. Overall, he finished with 11 swinging strikes on 24 swings, a pretty monstrous mark. It all just, mostly, looked like the same old Shane McClanahan. And while McClanahan has only given us one season of true ace-level production in 2022, he was a must-start pitcher in each of his other two seasons, and he sure looked like that guy on Thursday. There will be worse days to come, of course. Days where he just doesn't have it and he gets crushed – and I think those days will probably be a bit more common with the Rays no longer playing their home games in the pitcher's haven of Tropicana Field. And I still have my concerns about how much value McClanahan is likely to provide over the course of the full season since the Rays will have to find ways to limit his innings at various points after he didn't throw a single inning in 2024. But at the very least, I'm not actively avoiding McClanahan now. There will probably be other people in my drafts who are more excited about him, so I can't say I'm especially likely to end up with him on any of my teams in 2025. But I'm not opposed to it. For one start, that's a pretty big shift. In the rest of today's newsletter, we're going to go through a handful of other storylines from the past week of Spring Training to try to figure out what is real and what isn't, starting with an update from one of yesterday's injury situations. Before we get to that, though, I do want to highlight something for those of you getting ready to draft this weekend: Our Draft Prep walkthrough. This link has everything you need from Scott White, Frank Stampfl, and myself to draft the best team possible. And keep this one bookmarked: We'll be updating it plenty between now and Opening Day. When he left Wednesday's start early, Rodriguez said he wasn't worried about it, so I decided to not be too worried about it. He said there was no injury to be concerned about, and his velocity being down was by design, as he focused on building up arm strength earlier in the spring. So, that was a lie. Rodriguez was diagnosed with triceps soreness Thursday and will be re-evaluated Friday. At this point, we don't have any more details beyond that, so is that enough to justify a drop in the rankings? Believe it. I'll go a step further: I'm going to remove Rodriguez from my Breakouts 2.0 column. My interest in Rodriguez was mostly speculative, to begin with – he has a solid floor of skills, and I was betting on a step forward through further tweaks of his pitch usage and general improvement in his overall skill set. That may still happen. Maybe this injury is more or less a non-issue, they'll clear him to throw as soon as this weekend, and we'll barely remember this issue on the way to a Cy Young-caliber season. But it's harder to make an affirmative bet on Rodriguez taking a step forward when he's already dealing with an injury. I'll move Rodriguez into the mid-round flier range of the draft until we get more details and just hope this doesn't totally derail his season. There's still plenty of upside with Rodriguez, but you can say that about plenty of pitchers who aren't currently injured. De La Cruz has all the tools in the world, and the next step in his development is finding the best ways to put those tools into action more consistently. To that end, De La Cruz has tweaked his batting stance a bit this offseason, standing taller at the plate and more open toward the pitcher, in an effort to keep his swing more controlled – and cut down on his league-leading strikeout total from 2024. And it's hard to argue with the results so far, as De La Cruz has three homers and just four strikeouts in his first 20 plate appearances this spring. Don't believe it. I mean, sure, De La Cruz may take a step forward in his age-23 season. I can believe that. I just don't have much faith that a new setup at the plate is suddenly going to cure everything that ails him – and that's true for every guy who spent the offseason reworking their swing. Sometimes, it works, of course – Mookie Betts turned himself into more of a power hitter in his 30s thanks to his work with DriveLine, to name just one example. But we also saw Anthony Volpe remake his swing to become arguably a worse hitter in his second season, while others like Ty France were even worse after an offseason spent reworking their swings. Unlike with pitchers, where we can get a look at a few data points and start to model what a new pitch or added velocity might mean, projecting improvement for hitters is much tougher. It's good to see De La Cruz dominating early in the spring, but he's also doing exactly what should be expected of him against what has so far been essentially Triple-A-caliber opposition, per Baseball-Reference.com's spring stats. It wouldn't be especially worried if De La Cruz was 0 for 20 with 10 strikeouts, either, to be clear. It's just way too small of a sample size to go on, and I'm certainly not going to change my opinion of De La Cruz based on a few anecdotes about his new swing and five games worth of PA against inconsistent competition. Soroka made his second appearance of the spring Thursday and he continued to look absolutely terrific. Facing the Cardinals for the second time in six days, Soroka limited them to just one earned run while scattering six hits over four innings, with six strikeouts while getting his pitch count up to 61. And he did it while continuing to throw even harder than he did out of the bullpen last season – he averaged 94.6 mph on Thursday, up 1.1 mph from his time with the White Sox, and he was up even more in his first appearance. He's generated seven whiffs across 37 four-seamers and sinkers while adding three with his slider and one on four changeups. And Soroka has little doubt he can sustain this velocity increase as he pushes for six-inning outings. "Yeah, absolutely. I think I knew I could," he said after his first outing. "In relief last year, for the most part, I was still throwing multiple innings. And to be honest with you, the feeling of where the fastball got to at the end of inning three was really exciting because it feels like I can replicate it over and over again. Believe it. Look, the likeliest outcome is that Soroka doesn't amount to much for Fantasy. He hasn't thrown even 80 innings in an MLB season since 2019 when he posted a 2.68 ERA over 174.2 innings. Since then, he has suffered two separate ruptured Achilles tendon injuries, along with a forearm injury in 2023 and shoulder issues in each of the past two seasons. He's trying to overcome a slew of injuries that, frankly, looked like they would totally derail his career. But Soroka showed some real strikeout upside in a multi-inning relief role for the White Sox after transitioning to a four-seam/slider-heavy approach, and now that approach looks like it might be working even better. His four-seamer looks better than ever, and his sliders have a couple inches more break across both the horizontal and vertical planes, which could help it play up even more as a whiff pitch. Soroka has belonged on the late-round radar in H2H points leagues all along, simply because he is a starting pitcher with relief eligibility – I'll draft basically any SPaRP with a rotation spot, because even average production can be pretty valuable there. But I'm starting to move Soroka into the 300-ish range of the rankings even in my Roto leagues, just in case the flashes he's showing this spring are real. Again, I'd bet against him finishing as a top-50 pitcher this season, even if you gave me pretty good odds. But I would have bet against Reynaldo Lopez pulling that trick off this time last year too, so I'll keep an open mind here. And I'm opening it even more with every mid-90s fastball he throws past hitters. We talked about Alcantara last week, and since then we received a report from Jeff Passan that indicates the Marlins plan to limit Alcantara's innings early in the season. Given that Alcantara's main appeal for Fantasy has historically been the sheer, overwhelming volume he provides when he's on the mound, is it fair to say that he's going to be an afterthought for Fantasy at the beginning of the season? Don't believe it. I have no trouble believing the Marlins will look to limit Alcantara's exposure early on – Alcantara has said as much himself. But what I don't believe is the idea that we're looking at an inverted Garrett Crochet situation, where the Marlins routinely limit him to four innings and skip starts in April and May to keep his innings in line. That's not to say there won't be things that limit Alcantara's value. He'll be pitching for what I think is the worst team in baseball, which means wins are going to be tough to come by. And he's never really been a high-strikeout pitcher, though I do think he'll be better than his 19.8% strikeout rate in 2023 – and his new slider grip, which is leading to a bit more two-plane break with the pitch should help. He probably won't be a Fantasy ace early in the season, but I think he'll have plenty of appeal. I don't expect there to be many seven-plus inning starts early in the season, and there will probably be a few situations where he is pulled after five innings while cruising with 84 pitches, which will be frustrating. But I don't expect to see many situations where he is pulled after four innings, and by the time May and June roll around, we should expect Alcantara to look more or less like himself. There's only so long Miami can hold him back – and, of course, the potential for a trade looms as a big boost to his value. Henderson has been diagnosed with a mild intercostal strain, and while manager Brandon Hyde told reporters he is "very, very hopeful" Henderson will be ready for Opening Day, he stopped short of saying that's the plan as of now. A first-rounder missing significant time in Spring Training, with a chance to miss Opening Day? Yeah, that's tough to stomach. Don't believe it. Intercostal strains cost hitters an average of 21 days, per BaseballProspectus.com's Recovery Dashboard tool, which would put Henderson on track to return on March 21-23 if he follows that timetable. That would put him right on the cusp of being able to return in time for the end of spring games, the last of which is on the 23rd for the Orioles. It would be less than ideal for Henderson to return without getting back into a game, but it wouldn't be unprecedented – if memory serves, Corey Seager made the Opening Day lineup last season without playing in a spring game ahead of time after recovering from an injury. I did move Henderson down a few spots, but not out of the first round yet. And he really didn't go for any kind of discount on our H2H points Salary Cap/Auction Thursday night, coming off the board with a $41 price, the 13th-highest price of the night. If you wanted to push him down below the likes of Corbin Carroll and Vladimir Guerrero Jr. I wouldn't argue too much, but I'm not ready to go there yet. Gausman managed to piece together a decent Fantasy season in 2024 despite clearly not having his best stuff. The veteran put up a 3.83 ERA over 181 innings despite opening the season with a shoulder injury that derailed his spring, and with his strikeout rate collapsing from 31.1% to 21.4%. Well, so far this spring, Gausman's velocity is back to 2023 levels, as he averaged 94.9 mph with his four-seamer in Wednesday's spring start. That's pretty close to where Gausman has been at his best, which sure feels like a good sign. Believe it … mostly. I'm not entirely convinced Gausman is back to being who he was prior to 2024, to be clear. The velocity is a good sign, but there's a difference between doing it for a couple of innings and doing it for six innings 30-plus times. And the movement on Gausman's splitter isn't quite where it's been in the past, either – he was getting a couple of inches less vertical break with it than he was last year when he was already getting a couple of inches less vertical break with it than in 2023. And that's no small thing, given how much Gausman relies on his splitter for whiffs. Without his best splitter, Gausman won't be able to replicate his 2023 upside, so that's certainly something we'll want to keep an eye on over the next couple of weeks. But I was pretty much completely out on Gausman coming into the spring, thinking the chances of an age-34 bounceback were pretty slim. Now? Well, it's not the likeliest outcome, but I've moved Gausman from outside the top 200 in my rankings to closer to 150. I'll have him on a few teams just in case he can get back to it. Gil has been diagnosed with a lat strain, and Yankees general manager Brian Cashman acknowledged Thursday he's going to miss significant time. "Being a starter, he's got six weeks minimum of no throw and obviously it could be longer if it takes longer," Cashman said. "They'll reimage and re-MRI it and see where he's at during that rest period. So, is it six, is it going to be seven weeks, is it eight weeks, whatever, and then we'll get him going, and then he's got to go through a flat-ground throwing program and obviously bullpens and then rehab games, so you're talking three months." That feels like something close to a worst-case scenario for this injury, and Gil figures to now miss at least the first two months of the regular season if he avoids setbacks. Believe it. I mean, if you're in a league with a bunch of IL spots to play with, he's a fine stash. But if you only have three or fewer IL spots to work with, I think it's going to be extremely hard to keep Gil around when the season starts. Remember, we've still got 20 days until the season starts, and there will be more injuries between now and Opening Day to account for, plus our usual slew of early-April injuries to contend with. To highlight this point, here's an IL Stash Rankings piece from last April 9 where Scott White identified 13 can't-drop players, plus another 16 who are "really difficult to drop" and 34 total you'd want to have stashed; by the end of April, there were 42 stash-able players on Scott's updated list. Gil is a talented pitcher, but he was a long shot to repeat last year's success even before this injury totally derailed his spring. A high-3.00s ERA and a bunch of strikeouts have value even with an iffy WHIP, but it's not something worth waiting for – especially since the injury increases the degree of difficulty for Gil even more. If you're keeping track of Spring Training lineups, you might have noticed an awful lot of Rodriguez in the early going. He has already logged 22 PA, two-thirds of his total from last spring with more than two weeks left in the exhibition schedule. That's not a coincidence, and it's in conjunction with Rodriguez looking for more non-game reps against live pitching with the goal of making sure he avoids the slow starts that have become characteristic for the young outfielder. "I'm trying to get more reps, prepare myself a little bit better to hit the ground running," Rodríguez told MLB.com last week. "There's no better training in the league than against the pitchers that we've got over here." Believe it. Not necessarily because he's getting these extra reps in Grapefruit League action, though I'm certain that can't hurt. But mostly because I just don't believe Rodriguez's slow starts are likely to continue one way or another for much longer. Rodriguez is a career .238/.296/.347 hitter in March and April, which is really quite bad, obviously – by comparison, he has an OPS north of .900 in each of July, August, and September. But we're also still talking about just 328 plate appearances scattered across three seasons, one of which came when he was a 21-year-old rookie with no prior MLB experience. In 2023, he had a perfectly acceptable .743 OPS before May, so it's not even like he's been uniformly disastrous early in the season. That's not to say it's a fluke that he's gotten off to these slow starts. I just think he'll figure out whatever it is that has caused these slow starts, and if maximizing his early exposure to live pitching helps, I'm all for it. Rodriguez remains one of the most talented players in the league, and I'm happy to draft him at a discount this season with the hope he puts it all together for an entire season for the first time.
