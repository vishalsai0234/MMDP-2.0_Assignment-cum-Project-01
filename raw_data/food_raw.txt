Transform a slab of brisket into a hearty, festive meal with one of these techniques for the perfect corned beef. Vanessa Greaves is a Senior Editor at Allrecipes with nearly two decades of experience helping home cooks gain confidence in the kitchen. A self-taught cook who grew up reading cookbooks for fun, Vanessa lives and breathes the challenges faced by busy everyday cooks to get dinner on the table. Before you get started, it's helpful to know a little bit about the cut of beef you're about to cook. Corned beef is made from brisket, a cut of beef from the heavily exercised front limbs of the animal that is consequently tough and chewy. However, when corned beef has been soaked in a seasoned brine of water, curing salt, and spices, and also cooked low and slow with moist heat, the connective tissue in this muscle-bound cut melts down, making a tough cut of meat juicy and succulent. Now, here are four foolproof ways to cook corned beef: In your Instant Pot or pressure cooker, boiled, oven-braised, and in your slow cooker. Fork-tender brisket in a fraction of the time. That's the beauty of using your electric pressure cooker or Instant Pot multi-cooker to make corned beef. Txislanders Place corned beef on the trivet of your pressure cooker. Add any additional seasonings. Pour just enough water to cover. Cook the corned beef on high pressure for about 90 minutes. Release the pressure. If you want to make it corned beef and cabbage, add carrots and cabbage to the liquid surrounding the meat, and cook again on high pressure for about 10 to 15 more minutes. Jenbc27 Place the brined corned beef in a large pot or Dutch oven along with the liquid and spices that accompanied it in the package. Pour in enough water to cover the beef, then bring the water to a boil on the stovetop. Reduce the heat to a simmer, and cover the pot. A 3-pound corned beef could take three hours or more to become perfectly tender. Check the meat occasionally, adding more water if necessary. The beef is ready when it pulls apart easily. Tip: For a one-pot feast, you can add shredded cabbage and chunks of potatoes and carrots to the pot during the last half hour of cooking. KGora Use a large roasting pan or Dutch oven, with or without a rack, depending on the recipe you use. It could take about one hour or more per pound to cook, depending on the thickness of the roast. Since corned beef needs to cook with moist heat, you'll cover the pan or wrap the roast with aluminum foil to prevent it from drying out. Check the liquid as it cooks, replenishing it if needed. You can add vegetables during the last hour of cooking. Allrecipes Magazine Popping everything into the slow cooker is the easiest, most convenient way to cook corned beef. If you're cooking carrots and potatoes with the meat, consider adding them about halfway through. A 4-pound roast will take four to five hours on high, or eight to nine hours on low. Cabbage doesn't take much time to cook, and can be added in the last hour. When using raw brisket, cook it to a minimum internal temperature of 145 degrees F measured with a food thermometer. If you'd like to prepare your own corned beef from a fresh brisket, allow about a week for the brisket to soak in the brine. Recipes to Brine and Cook Corned Beef:

Here's how to make your favorite recipe stand out from the crowd. Take your go-to recipe from favorite to famous! Chances are you're reading this because you enjoy cooking and sharing food with others. Posting one of your own recipes on Allrecipes is a great way to share your creations with a much larger crowd! Whether you improvise your way around the kitchen, tend to tweak ingredients to get the tastiest result, or follow steps methodically, a recipe is the common starting point. At Allrecipes, we get thousands of recipe submissions every year. Here are some top tips to help your recipe stand out from the crowd and get published on the site for everyone to find, try, and review! Choose a clear title that tells the cook what to expect and includes search-friendly words. "Andouille and Chicken Creole Pasta" tells us more about the dish than "Mardi Gras Pasta." Since other cooks often search by ingredient, "Andouille and Chicken Creole Pasta" is more likely to pop up. Include a short but detailed sentence describing the dish that will get the cook excited and tell them what to expect. Check out AppleChef's description for Pan-Seared Tilapia for example: "This pan-seared tilapia dish is a delicious and easy way to prepare seafood! Great for a quick weeknight meal accompanied with fresh veggies. Try this healthy dish full of flavor and nutrition!" FUNKYSEAMONKEY's description for Best Toffee Ever - Super Easy includes an extra tip about which nuts to use: "Chocolate and almonds top off a rich buttery toffee. A simple recipe that you could easily remember and whip up any time. I always get compliments and requests for more. Use any type of nut that you like in place of the almonds." To help your recipe editor, please stick to basic text and avoid italics, bold type, excess punctuation, and emojis. Include measurementsFor other cooks to get the same result you did, it's helpful for ingredients to be as exact and descriptive as possible. Instead of "cheese, parsley to taste, and garlic," write "1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese; ¼ cup chopped fresh parsley, or to taste; and 1 clove garlic, crushed." List ingredients in orderTo make a recipe easy to follow, list the ingredients in the order they are used in the recipe. Include ingredient prep
If a recipe requires chopped onion, shredded Cheddar cheese, and diced avocado, write that out in the ingredient list (like heathg did in this Breakfast Pita Pizza) rather than telling the cook to chop, shred, and dice in the steps below. Be descriptiveWrite out each step and be as thorough and descriptive as possible, using every ingredient that is listed. Instead of "mix everything together" write "Mix flour, milk, eggs, and sugar together in a bowl until batter is smooth." Include temperaturesFor recipes that use the oven, include a preheating step and give an exact oven temperature, e.g., 350 degrees F. For stovetop recipes, state how hot the burners need to be, e.g., medium heat, medium-high heat. Give pan size and typeFor baking recipes especially, the wrong size or type of cake pan can seriously affect the outcome of a recipe. Be descriptive and include exact dimensions for any pans used, such as: 9-inch round cake pan, 8-inch square baking dish, 9-inch springform pan, etc. Include doneness tipsLet the cook know how to tell if the dish is done by including tips and/or temperature guidelines. For example, when baking a cake instead of "Bake for 30 minutes," this is more helpful: "Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center comes about clean, about 30 minutes." Need a great example to follow? Cindy's detailed, step-by-step directions for her Italian Lemon Cream Cake have earned the recipe 5 stars with loads of glowing reviews! Always add a prep and cook time when submitting your recipe. If your recipe doesn't require cooking, put a zero in the cook time section. Snap a pic of your final dish to show everyone what it should look like and how appetizing it is! Here's a handy checklist for all the things you should include in your recipe to set it up for success: Now you're ready to share your recipe with the world!

For amateur and pro bakers alike, there's no recipe more appropriate for St. Patrick's Day than soda bread. (Irish heritage optional.) I'll walk you through how to make our most popular Irish soda bread recipe—with plenty of how-to tips along the way—and give you variations to try. Irish soda bread is one of those unicorn recipes that's hard to mess up and can withstand seemingly countless variations. While professionals will surely put a special flourish on their loaf, Irish soda bread is excellent for novices since there's no intimidating yeast, no rising, practically no kneading, and no fancy shaping to worry about. Just mix, quickly knead, dump onto a baking sheet or cast iron pan, and bake. Depending on the recipe, the result might be more or less bread-like in texture, or it might be more akin to scones or biscuits. While it won't be sandwich bread, it'll be darn good slathered with butter. Here's the low-down on this quintessential St. Patrick's Day recipe along with one of our favorite recipes plus a few others, and some tips and tricks to help you achieve soda bread perfection. At this point it's widely recognized that Indigenous peoples of the Americas were the first to use something like baking soda to leaven their bread in lieu of yeast. They used pearl ash (made from a solution of burnt ash and water that was cooked down until it became a baking soda-like powder), and in the mid-1800s there was enough travel between Ireland and the US happening that the Irish adapted this method back home with the newly available bicarbonate soda—i.e., baking soda. The technique was well suited for Irish soft wheat flour, which didn't produce enough gluten to rise properly when combined with yeast. Bicarbonate soda was cheap and plentiful, and many Irish families grew wheat and had cows (and thus could make buttermilk—or, more commonly in the 19th century, sour milk). Most families didn't have their own oven but could bake the bread in a cast iron Dutch oven over a fire. Using baking soda produced a denser bread than one made with yeast, but it got the job done and provided an easy, affordable, accessible, nutritious everyday bread, and as such became commonplace throughout Ireland. Irish immigrants then brought the recipe with them to America, and Irish-Americans put their own touches on the recipe. Today, soda bread is a quintessential Irish recipe and has become a beloved (and delicious) St. Patrick's Day tradition. Get ready to nerd out. Though most bread relies on yeast to rise, Irish soda bread utilizes baking soda. For this reason, the reality is that Irish soda bread is much closer to a quick bread or scone than a loaf of bread. It rises thanks to a process called chemical leavening, in which the baking soda (a base) reacts when it's mixed with something acidic like buttermilk to produce carbon dioxide. While it's baking, the trapped carbon dioxide gas in the dough (don't worry, it's not toxic) tries to escape and thus makes the dough rise slightly. It's kitchen science magic! Irish Soda Bread, recipe by Penguin Lady Ready to get baking? This recipe for Irish soda bread is one of the most made, best-reviewed soda bread recipes on Allrecipes — and for good reason. Reviewer MMEMEIS raves, "This Irish soda bread beat out our family recipe that was used for decades." Try it and see for yourself, and see below for some tips and variations. Ingredients Directions 2. In a mixing bowl, combine flour (reserving 1 tablespoon), sugar, baking powder, baking soda, salt, raisins (or currants), and caraway seeds. In a small bowl, blend eggs, buttermilk and sour cream. Stir the liquid mixture into flour mixture just until flour is moistened. 3. Knead dough in bowl about 10 to 12 strokes. Dough will be sticky. Place the dough in the prepared skillet or pan and pat down. Cut a 4x¾-inch deep slit in the top of the bread. Dust with reserved flour. 4. Bake in the preheated oven for 65 to 75 minutes. Let cool and turn bread onto a wire rack. Katherine Martinelli Sticky dough. The recipe says that the dough will be sticky — but it is really sticky. So sticky that it's a little hard to knead; I didn't get in a full 10 strokes and it still turned out great, so never fear. Some reviewers said they skipped this step entirely and it was fine; many noted that they were nervous about the consistency but that it baked up perfectly. Raisins or currants. While the recipe calls for 3 cups of raisins, I followed the lead of many reviewers and cut it down to 2 cups, which seemed like plenty. I also used currants instead of raisins, which was delicious. Some folks used just 1 cup, and some cut them out entirely. Others successfully substituted dried cranberries, chopped dried apricots, or a mix of dried fruit. Need for seeds. Caraway seeds give this a rich flavor that is a nice savory counterpoint to the sweet currants or raisins. But, if caraway isn't your thing (think of the flavor of rye bread), then leave it out (many reviewers did so and reported that it was still delicious). Flour power. A few reviewers took issue with the tablespoon of flour sprinkled over the loaf before it is baked, but this is part of what gives it that pretty bakery look. That being said, I only used about 1 teaspoon flour on top and thought that was enough. Skillet vs. cake pan vs. baking sheet. Penguin Lady says to bake this in a cast iron pan (that's what I did) or a cake pan, but you can also bake it on a parchment-lined baking sheet if that's what you have handy. This dense bread won't lose its shape. X marks the spot. Irish soda bread traditionally has a big X sliced into the top, but this is more a matter of aesthetics and tradition than necessity (some say it's meant to look like a cross to either ward off the devil or bless the bread, while others like to say it lets out any fairies that might be trapped in the dough). So, if you have trouble getting a perfect cross cut into it, don't sweat it. Reviewer M Unit suggests dipping your knife in flour before making your X for a clean cut. Buttermilk substitution. If you don't have buttermilk, you can make your own substitute: put 1 tablespoon plus ¾ teaspoon lemon juice or vinegar into a measuring cup then pour in milk (anything from skim to whole will work) until it reaches 1¼ cups. Mix it together and you've got your buttermilk replacement (the acid from the lemon juice is enough to activate the baking soda). Lower the sugar. For those who are wary of the sugar, reviewer Despina Belle-Isle reports that having made it at various times with regular sugar and Splenda, she didn't find much change in taste when using the sugar substitute. Lower the fat. To make this recipe low fat, numerous reviewers said they used low fat sour cream with great success. Motherbird substituted plain yogurt, which she said also worked well. Saving leftovers. Irish soda bread is at its absolute best when it is fresh out of the oven, preferably slathered with good butter. If you have any left the next day, lightly toast a slice before enjoying or, for a real treat, do as Nikki did and use it to make French toast. Or, if you know you won't eat it all on day one, freeze it. I like to wrap slices in plastic wrap then put in a freezer bag so I can pull out one at a time whenever a craving strikes. Stick it in the toaster and enjoy some nearly fresh baked goodness. While Penguin Lady's Irish soda bread recipe is spot on, some would argue that it's not "authentic" and is instead an Irish-American variation known as spotted dog soda bread. At this point I would argue that it's authentically Irish-American, but if you want to try your hand at the super simple version we've got you covered. Or, want it gluten free, or perhaps in muffin form? Here are some other great versions to try. Real Traditional Irish Soda Bread If you want to see what real deal, no-frills Irish soda bread recipe tastes like, then this recipe by barry is just the ticket. It calls for just four ingredients: flour, salt, baking soda, and buttermilk. Reviewer mul exclaims, "finally someone actually knows that Irish bread does NOT contain raisins or caraway or butter; perfect recipe." And CINJOY4 says, "wonderful flavor and texture for such a simple recipe. I've tried several Irish soda bread recipes and this has trumped them all." Irish Soda Bread Muffins As recipe author joaniecny says, "one bowl, mix, bake for 20 minutes, and you have tasty muffins!" It doesn't get much better than that. This portable, shareable rendition of Irish soda bread is a keeper. As lutzflcat reviews, "This muffin is the best of savory and sweet, the raisin-caraway seed combo is a winner, it's tender, and the texture is just firm enough, but not dense. And OMG, are they quick and easy to make." Gluten-Free Irish Soda Bread If a gluten intolerance or lifestyle choice has had you missing out on your yearly Irish soda bread binge, ChristinaBunny has come up with a crowd-pleasing solution: she uses gluten free rice and tapioca flour in place of all-purpose or whole wheat flour. Reviewer misspotatohed raves, "This recipe is fabulous. It was easy to make and tastes awesome. You wouldn't even know it was gluten free." Many reviewers did note that their bread was done much quicker than the recipe said. Irresistible Irish Soda Bread For a soda bread that is more like a quick bread in texture, try out this recipe by Karin Christian. Her recipe, which is baked in a loaf pan, includes an egg, melted butter, and baking powder in addition to baking soda, which gives it a more cake-like taste and feel. Many reviewers noted that if you've tried Irish soda bread in the past and not been the biggest fan, then this version might be for you (it's definitely not for the purists). Related

TITLE: Slow-Roasted Salmon and More Recipes We Made This Week
DATE: March 7, 2025
CONTENT:
It’s no secret that Bon Appétit editors cook a lot for work. So it should come as no surprise that we cook a lot during our off hours too. Here are the recipes we’re whipping up this month to get dinner on the table, entertain our friends, satisfy a sweet tooth, use up leftovers, and everything in between. For even more staff favorites, click here. I ate senior test kitchen editor Shilpa Uskokovic’s basil chicken stir-fry—a stunning addition to the Bon Appétit 56—countless times as she made it in the test kitchen. Then I eagerly went home and cooked it myself. I never imagined I could like the texture of ground chicken, but Shilpa’s cooking method (adding a little baking soda) shape-shifts the meat so that it’s delightfully springy, not the mealy texture I’m used to. With hardworking ingredients like fish sauce, hot chili paste, and basil, it’s tempting to eat the whole thing straight out of the pan with a spoon. Then I remembered the frozen block of noodles sitting in my freezer, plunged them into boiling water, and tossed them into the saucy chicken. —Jesse Szewczyk, senior test kitchen editor If you are ambitious, you can make this recipe for lamb and zucchini dumplings in its entirety. I’ve made them before, dumpling wrappers and all, and it’s a fun project. But the real reason I keep it bookmarked is for the crispy skirt. Once the dumplings go into the pan, you pour in a flour slurry mixed with a splash of vinegar. The solution steams the potstickers before reducing to a thin, cracker-like layer that adheres to the wrappers in one big saucer you then crack apart. The vinegar lends a salt-and-vinegar-chip vibe that’s undeniably moreish. And it works with frozen dumplings too. I toss them into the pan straight out of the freezer. They take a little extra time to cook, but anyone I serve them to is no less impressed. —Joe Sevier, senior editor, SEO and cooking I have been wanting a soothing wedding soup to turn to, so last week I riffed on this low-commitment one from Claire Saffitz, and this hearty one with noodles from the food blog Sweet Savory and Steph. I used ground lamb to make the mini meatballs, and ended up double-batching the recipe. That meant rolling out about 100 balls. This may seem like a lot, but I found the process to be meditative. The finished product has a medley of textures: al dente veggies, bouncy noodles, and tender meatballs. —Urmila Ramakrishnan, associate director of social media I love a recipe with a forgiving ingredient list and Eric Kim’s Chickpea Salad With Gim is just that. I riffed on the specifics based on what I had around: a can of chickpeas with a packet of gim, and instead of red onion, a mix of shallot and scallion. From there, you can eyeball the dressing: a creamy, umami meld of mayo, sesame oil, rice vinegar, salt, pepper, and sugar. It was equal parts quick and delightful, plus vegetarian with a welcome salty-brininess. I opted for a heap of rice and some butter-sizzled kimchi as accompaniments, but it would also be great with crackers or lettuce cups. —Emma Laperruque, associate director of cooking I spent last weekend in Ojai, California, for a bachelorette party/wedding celebration for one of my best friends. My job, as determined by the bride, was “food.” This meant assembling a huge platter of Turkish eggs and salads one morning, splattering pancake batter all over myself the next, and, finally, slow-roasting a side of salmon for our Oscar’s watch party dinner. I used Alison Roman’s recipe on the site, which features thinly sliced fennel, citrus picked ripe from the yard (a dream), and lots of dill. Even in a questionably appointed Airbnb kitchen, it was easy to make and a huge hit. —Kendra Vaculin, test kitchen editor

TITLE: Should Kids Be Allowed in Fine Dining Restaurants?
DATE: March 6, 2025
CONTENT:
Can I send a dish back just because I didn't like it? How do we split the check without causing a fight in the group chat? In Code of Conduct, our restaurant etiquette column, we explore the do’s and don’ts and IDKs of being a good diner. Who could forget the infamous Alinea Baby incident of 2014, when someone brought an eight-month-old to Grant Achatz’s three-Michelin-starred Chicago restaurant? “Tbl brings 8mo.Old,” Achatz tweeted. “It cries. Diners mad. Tell ppl no kids? Subject diners 2crying?" It would seem we have yet to find a good solution to Achatz’s dilemma. The year 2022 gave us Reddit Woman, who asked to switch tables in a fancy restaurant because she was seated near a crying baby, then was purportedly called an a**hole by the baby’s mother. More recently, a British diner who spent 300 British pounds (about $378) on a fancy dinner seethed that “selfish” parents should leave their kids at home: “Deliveroo exists for a reason,” she wrote on the parenting blog Mumsnet. “Babies need sleep, not fine dining.” (In a poll posted under her complaint, 73% of the nearly 4,000 respondents assured her she was not being unreasonable.) It’s easy to groan when you spot a stroller entering a hallowed dining room with its tweezered food or feel personally attacked if a toddler’s shrieks pierce the hushed tones. After all, you paid a lot for a memorable night—and not that kind of memorable. Still, some fine dining restaurants go to great lengths to accommodate parents with small children, a generosity aimed at making families feel welcome. Of course, there’s a big difference between providing an unforgettable experience for an excited child and being forced to run damage control so other diners don’t start fuming. Between some good judgment on the part of parents, fellow diners showing a bit of grace, and restaurants wanting to extend hospitality to families, the presence of kids in pricey restaurants doesn’t have to provoke such rage. “‘Alinea baby’ was a pivotal moment for a lot of us,” says Michael Muser, co-owner and director of operations at two-Michelin-starred Ever Restaurant and After Lounge in Chicago. (As of February 18, 2025, Muser announced he’s departing Ever and After to pursue solo projects.) “We realized our Michelin-starred restaurant doesn’t care if you bring your babies. I want you in my restaurant. The onus is on us to manage; that’s what we do.” Not all chefs are so open to having kids in their dining rooms, though. Dave Beran, chef and owner of Seline in Santa Monica, puts his cerebral, 18-course tasting menu on par with attending a three-hour play with mature themes. “The reality is we’re crafting an adult experience that requires a certain level of maturity and understanding,” says Beran, father to a five-month-old and two-and-a-half-year-old. “It’s 100 percent on the parents to decide if their child has the capacity to understand and act in an acceptable manner within those parameters.” The last thing a restaurant wants—particularly one that might host only 50 diners each night—is to turn away customers. But some find ways to say “no kids” without actually saying it. Carbone doesn’t allow strollers in any of its locations, a guest relations representative told Bon Appétit in an email. Seline doesn’t have high chairs, mostly due to a lack of storage space. Beran hasn’t needed any yet, anyway. Parents take their kids to his more casual French bistro, Pasjoli, where staff have had to politely ask several to “rein in their kids,” he says. “We don’t ever want to be the ones to tell a parent that they’re not doing the best job parenting.” For some parents, the price and stakes of fancy dining as a family feel too high to be worth the hassle. Chicago-based parents Bill Higgins and Jessica Dixon love an occasional over-the-top dinner, but they don’t take their two young children along. “Partly, it feels wasteful,” Higgins says. “The biggest thing for me is not intruding on other diners spending $500 a person. I’d rather die.” The couple regularly takes their two- and four-year-old to nice neighborhood restaurants—interesting, chef-driven, comfortable places. They’re proud their daughter loves crushing raw oysters and that the family can share this slice of city life. They’re also acutely aware of their parameters for a successful outing. The couple seeks places where other families dine and sit on the patio when possible. They prefer brunch or dinner right when the restaurant opens—a.k.a. Baby Hour, something that savvy urban restaurants are increasingly keen to accommodate. The couple places an order for the kids the moment the server arrives and requests the check when their own food comes in case a tantrum starts brewing. “It’s on the restaurant to make you feel good, but there’s a contract you’ve got as the parent where you’ve gotta try to hoe your row and make sure your kids are behaving as well,” Higgins says. Dressed-down fine dining spot Fancypants in Nashville deploys a myriad of time- and labor-intensive techniques to nip disruptive situations—which range from tantrums to kids on loud iPads—in the bud. The staff offers up tours of the kitchen, card games, or empty private dining space. Similarly, Ever, with its elegantly serene dining room and up to 10 courses of otherworldly dishes, prepares exhaustively for children, much like it would accommodate customers with dietary or mobility restrictions. Staff suggest private dining room seating to families if available, or seat them at tables slightly removed from the rest of the dining room with easy restroom access. They designate space for feeding or calming and for stroller parking. If the children are old enough and parents give the okay, the server whisks the kids back to the pastry kitchen when the final protein course arrives. “Mom and Dad get to eat Wagyu and enjoy a course and intermezzo after that,” Muser says. “We’ve got your kids for eight, maybe 10 minutes in the kitchen. They put on an apron and play ‘make a dessert’ with our pastry chef.” By paying as much as they do, customers are right to have high expectations, whether or not they have a child in tow, Muser says. But it’s also on parents to communicate their needs clearly and upfront. Ultimately, a chef is not a babysitter. Higgins was surprised to learn Ever is so accommodating of young children. Even so, he says he’ll hold off on bringing his own until they’re older. “When we take our kids to restaurants, we want to fit in,” he says. “In these places where the choreography is perfect, and there’s a hushed, hallowed feeling, my kid would not fit in. I’m sure [the restaurant] would try hard to make us feel good, so it’s not a lack of hospitality. But I’d feel stressed.”

TITLE: 8 Coolest Wine Decanters to Show Off That Great Bottle You Just Bought
DATE: March 7, 2025
CONTENT:
All products are independently selected by our editors. If you buy something, we may earn an affiliate commission. Regardless of what your most annoyingly opinionated friend says, there’s no singular, correct way to serve wine (can you drink wine out of a water glass? Yes, yes you can). Whatever you think is the right way to do it, you can find an article that will confirm you’re right and one that will indignantly tell you you’re wrong. Writing as a person who sometimes walks into a wine store and says, “cold, please!” I don’t have particularly strong convictions about the matter. I have learned enough about wine to understand how decanting can impact the drinking experience of a particular vintage, though. And a good wine decanter is something worth having, even if you’re a casual drinker. Decanting wine involves pouring out a bottle into another vessel. There are a couple reasons to do this; one is to separate out the sediment from the bottom of the bottle, the other is to aerate wine. Aerating, i.e., exposing wine to oxygen, softens the bitter tannic flavors and allows the aroma of the wine to bloom. I’m not going to litigate exactly how important those aspects are to enjoying any particular bottle of wine, but I am still a fan of decanters, and you should be too. Wine decanters are shaped to maximize air exposure, and some really take this prompt and run with it, often with some particularly creative design results. Not only will a cool decanter make your wine more pleasant to drink (probably), but it will also serve as a functional work of art on your dinner table. Take a look below to find some of the coolest wine decanters available to buy online. Each one has something unique going for it and are destined to elicit praise at your next dinner party.  Holcomb Birdie Glass Wine Decanter Food52 The decanter by Holcomb Studios gets its name from the stainless-steel aerator shaped like a badminton birdie. Like the rest of Holcomb’s homewares, there’s an almost sci-fi edge to the look of this decanter. It comes with an ash wood trivet and a small metal coaster to put the aerator on after you’re done with it. It’s a smart modular design that looks just as cool in action as it does on passive display.  Alessi Eugenia Wine Decanter Ssense Alessi has been around for over 100 years, but the Italian housewares brand continues to manufacture modern yet cheeky designs of nearly anything you’d find in the kitchen. This wine decanter is frankly understated for Alessi (compare, for example, to this coffee maker), but its exaggerated angles evoke the midcentury retrofuturism they are known for.  La Riccia Pinch Decanter Il Buco Vita There’s a charming rough-hewn and organic quality to Il Buco Vita’s handblown glassware. Each decanter is different, with slight undulations and curves on the surface that celebrates the artisan process required to make them.  Fazeek Vice Versa Carafe Fazeek Australian brand Fazeek was founded in 2017 and makes all sorts of cheery, brightly colored glassware. This is technically a more all-purpose carafe, but the design makes it suitable for decanting wine as well. The glass sphere stopper lives underneath the cavity in the base of the piece. Don’t worry, though, there is a little flat spot on the stopper so it won’t roll away when you lift it up.  Sofia Smoked Glass Wine Decanter by Gianfranco Frattini CB2 This decanter is an original design by the architect Gianfranco Frattini, who created them for use in haute Italian dining establishments in the 1980s. The smoked glass version is a contemporary riff on the classic shape, and gives it a more sultry evening vibe.  Audo Copenhagen Decanter Design Within Reach The coolest thing about this decanter is how it decants. You place the entire decanter on top of the bottle of wine before inverting them both. The wine cascades around the inside of the glass surface as it pours out the bottle, which not only aerates the wine quite effectively but gives your dinner guests a bit of a show.  Maison Balzac Le Citrus Decanter FWRD Why is there an orange slice on top of this wine decanter? Why not? Maison Balzac’s thing is quirky and fun glassware, and it’s probably best known for its little glass fruit motifs. Some of the brand’s designs are more decorative than practical, but this decanter can definitely go either way.  Ichendorf Milano Snail Glass Decanter Farfetch If you like a dose of whimsy in your life, then Ichendorf Milano will be your speed. The borosilicate glass vessel features a small snail climbing up the side, and there’s a little glass twig too. Fragile? Perhaps, but c’mon, it’s undeniably cute.

TITLE: The Best Rice Cookers for Effortless Fluffy Rice Every Time
DATE: January 30, 2025

You might not think a rice cooker belongs in the same class of essential cooking tools as, say, a chef’s knife or cutting board, but think again: If you eat rice on a regular basis, owning one of these appliances will change your life for the better. Here at Bon Appétit, we typically shy away from recommending single-use cooking gadgets, but a rice cooker is an exception to that rule. After years of testing, we can confirm that there’s simply no easier, more effective way to make a perfect pot of rice—and that no rice cooker will do so better than our top pick, the Zojirushi NP-HCC10. I was introduced to the world of Zojirushi rice cookers in college, when my roommate bought one for our house. I didn’t fully realize how spoiled I’d been until we graduated and that roommate moved across the country, taking her rice cooker with her—and leaving me to make due with finicky stovetop rice that never turned out quite right. After testing lots of rice cookers and making lots of rice, I can confidently say I’ll never be without a rice cooker again. Having consistently fluffy, well-cooked rice at the touch of a button means I can turn my attention to all the other components that make up a meal, and that’s a convenience well worth the price tag—and extra storage space—a rice cooker comes with. And besides, there’s nothing as humbling as cooking a big pot of rice for company only to find it’s turned into a pile of mush. The best rice cookers are like a kitchen cheat code, a helping hand that ensures at least one part of your meal will go off without a hitch. But not all rice cookers are created equal. While they’re all designed to do pretty much the same thing (plus or minus a few bells and whistles), our product testers’ years of research have revealed that these cookers vary a lot in terms of performance. That’s why we’re here to give you the low down, so you can choose the best rice cooker for your own lifestyle, budget, and household size. Also in this story… New in this update: We tested several new rice cookers, including from Korean brand Cuckoo, that is growing its footprint in the United States. But most importantly we found a new best budget rice cooker for those who think Zojirushi induction models, no matter how good, are a bit too pricey.  Zojirushi NP-HCC10XH Induction Heating System Rice Cooker Amazon Target Best Buy Pros: Consistent results, wide range of capabilities
Cons: Expensive, the bulky cord is not retractable
Best for: If you want a high-quality rice cooker that's easy to use for some simple meal prep. Zojirushi has been a top player in the rice cooker space for as long as anyone at BA can remember, much like Vitamix is for blenders or KitchenAid for stand mixers. They have 19 models on the market currently, seven of which we’ve tested. Out of all of those, plus the 24 models from other brands we've tried, we think the NP-HCC10 is the best option for most home cooks (make sure to note the model here, because all of Zojirushi’s model names look like a messy alphabet soup). There are a few reasons for that, but the most important thing about the NP-HCC10 is that it combines the Micom (short for microcomputerized) technology found in many of the brand’s cookers with an induction heating element that’s more specific to this tier of Zojirushis. The Micom functionality refers to sensors built into the rice cooker that adjust temperature and cook time according to real time feedback, acting as a safeguard against imprecise water-to-rice ratios (to a certain degree, at least). What makes the NP-HCC10 special is the addition of induction heating capabilities, which mean the cooker can maintain a precise temperature and conduct heat evenly across the whole pot—not the case with rice cookers that use a bottom-only, non-induction heating element. In theory this should translate to evenly cooked, perfectly fluffy rice, every time, which proved true in our blind taste tests. BA staffers crowned this machine the winner time and time again, noting the way it produced grains that were not too soft, not too hard, and never mushy. While the quality of the rice was our number one criteria in ranking these cookers, we also gave points for other helpful design choices and features. The NP-HCC10 has a 5.5 cup (uncooked) capacity which should be enough to feed six people more or less. It’s fitted with a nonstick pot that’s a breeze to clean and has markings for the amount of water to add for various types of rice clearly labeled in white on its interior (do note that the size of the cup that comes with the rice cooker and the markings inside the pot don’t correspond to a normal 8-ounce cup, instead they are based on a ¾ cup measure). As for features, we loved that this model counts down the total cook time, which was a surprising rarity among the rice cookers we tested. Our testers also liked the Keep Warm setting, which switches on automatically when the rice is done cooking and kept rice fresh for hours. There’s even an extended Keep Warm setting meant to help prevent any yellowing or drying out of rice left to sit for longer periods of time. There is also a timer setting that allows you to set your rice to be done cooking at a certain time, which is great if you want to prep a pot of rice before work and have it ready by the time you get home in the evening. The NP-HCC10 also offers 9 programmed cooking settings for several different types of rice, including jasmine, brown, and sushi (note that the “white rice” setting on a Zojirushi refers to short-grain white rice). If you're interested in cooking other grains, like quinoa or oats, check out Zojirushi's guide for that here. There’s very little to complain about with the NP-HCC10 other than price. Typically retailing for a little over $300, it’s a bit of an investment piece, but one we think is wholly worth springing for if you eat rice regularly at home. Another thing to note is that if you’re new to the world of precision rice cookers, you may be surprised at how long it takes to make a pot of rice. Depending on the volume, you can expect white rice to take up to an hour, and brown rice up to two. But that’s not a shortcoming of nice rice cookers. It’s, in fact, part of the reason they work so well. Once you get into the habit of starting your rice cooker up before beginning the rest of your cooking, you likely won’t have any issue with this, though if you’re tight on time on weeknights you may find the timer function comes in handy for guaranteeing your rice will be done by a certain time. The only other nitpicky qualm is the machine’s lack of a retractable cord, which can make storage just a bit more of a hassle.

Hamilton Beach Digital Programmable Rice Cooker Amazon Wayfair Pros: Consistently good rice, affordable, handy features
Cons: Rice can get scorched on the bottom; brown rice may be too al dente for some
Best for: First-time rice cooker buyers looking for an easy to use and super affordable machine that still offers some premium features. If you want to make great rice at the touch of a button but you don't want to spend $300 to do so, the Hamilton Beach Digital Programmable Rice Cooker is the model for you. It pleasantly surprised us in our most recent round of testing by ranking right behind the Zojirushi in a side-by-side blind tasting of white rice. It excelled in the brown rice test, producing individual and intact grains that had a satisfying amount of bite to them (though if you prefer your brown rice on the softer side, we'd recommend adding a bit more water than the recommended amount). It also fared well with long-grain basmati, producing a pot of fluffy rice that was on par with (if not better than) some of the more expensive cookers we tested. But what we really loved about the Hamilton Beach is that despite its low price tag ($53 at the time of publication), it doesn't sacrifice some of the helpful features the more high-end cookers tends to have. There are six presets to choose from (white rice, quick rice, whole grain, heat/simmer, steam cook, and hot cereals), a handy delayed start feature, a cook time countdown, and an audible beep when the rice is done cooking—all things our previous budget pick, the Tiger JBV-A10U, lacked. Its 7-cup (uncooked) capacity is also larger than that of many of the other rice cookers we tested, but the machine's footprint is comparably compact. It's also technically a multi-cooker thanks to the heat/simmer and steam cook settings, though we were primarily interested in its rice-making capabilities for the purposes of this review and will not vouch for those other functions here. While we found the Hamilton Beach to be pretty well-made for a $50 machine, it didn't feel quite as sturdy as the higher-end models we tested. We also didn't love the design of the lid: It requires you to press and hold a button while manually opening it, and opens sideways rather than front to back. The inner pot is also relatively thin, which contributed to a scorched layer of rice at the bottom in some of our tests—something that wasn't a deal breaker for us in the end, but is worth noting. And, unlike many other models we tested, there is no differentiation between how much water to add for different types of rice. That said, we didn't find that this negatively impacted the resulting rice (though the brown rice, which had nice bite to it, could be a tad al dente for some with the recommended amount of water). Many rice cookers these days try to position themselves as do-it-all appliances (the Instant Pot-ification of the category), but we were here to see how each model performed at one all-important function: making rice. We’ve spent years testing over two dozen models and have held numerous taste tests among Bon Appétit staffers, abiding by the following testing process each time: Each rice cooker was first put through a white rice test. We used Nishiki Japanese medium-grain white rice, cooking two cups worth in each full-sized cooker and one cup in the mini cookers (models with four cup uncooked capacities or less). Models that performed adequately in this test then moved onto short-grain brown rice, and finally to long-grain basmati rice. Our tasters were on the lookout for fluffy pots of rice made up of nicely individualized grains that had just enough bite and didn’t mush together. Cookers that fared well in our initial testing were then given to several different editors to use in their own homes. Those editors have and will continue to provide feedback on how these models perform in the long term. While we evaluated rice cookers based on several factors, no amount of fancy features or high tech claims mattered if the resulting rice wasn’t up to par. Our testers and tasters scored models on the quality of all three kinds of rice, and were looking for evenly-cooked grains that were neither over nor undercooked, not too wet and not too dry, and fluffy rather than gummy or mushy. The whole point of having a rice cooker is to make your life easier, so we were looking for rice cookers that were straightforward and intuitive to use. We valued clear instructions on how to wash and measure rice, guidance on water ratios and selecting settings, and automatic Keep Warm functionality. A timer function was an added bonus that we appreciated in some of the more advanced models. We also looked at the accessories each model came with. Every rice cooker comes with a few necessities, which usually include a rice paddle and a measuring cup. Every model we tested, save for the Cuckoos, came with a built-in paddle holder, and many came with an additional steamer basket insert. While we didn’t test out steamer or synchro cooking functionality in our initial tests, our long-term testers were encouraged to report back on how such functions performed. Nearly every model we tested had a nonstick coating on its inner pot, and the few that didn’t were a bit of a nightmare to clean. We wanted to be able to cleanly scoop rice out of the cooker without leaving any residue behind, and looked for pots that were easily washed with soapy sponge and some warm water (if you are really trying to avoid PFAS coatings, note that most rice cooker pots have a nonstick coating are not dishwasher-safe). Some models have removable, cleanable lids, something we appreciated and noted where applicable. We took note of the footprint of each model, but found that most full-sized options were around the same size. The rice cookers we tested ranged in price from $25 to $750. While we think a great model like our winning Zojirushi is worth its $300 price tag, we awarded points to models like the Hamilton Beach that provide a great value, performing better than their cost might suggest. To make a long story short, you probably should. Washing rice strips the grains of their starchy coating and keeps them from sticking together and becoming a gummy mess when cooked—something you definitely want, for most types of rice at least (exceptions to this rule include rice used for risotto, where the excess starch is necessary to create that creamy texture). In testing these cookers, we followed each model’s instructions with regard to rinsing rice. In general, you’ll want to swish your measured rice around in some water, pour that water out, and repeat until the water runs clear.  Zojirushi NW-JEC10BA Pressure Induction Heating (IH) Rice Cooker & Warmer, 5.5-Cup, Made in Japan Amazon Target Zojirushi What we think of the Zojirushi NW-JEC10 The Zojirushi NW-JEC10 is like if Apple made a rice cooker: It’s sleek, high tech, and expensive. It’s the most expensive home rice cooker in the brand’s lineup, as a matter of fact. Of its host of features, the one that sets it apart from the other high-end models Zojirushi offers is the “My Rice” setting, which uses artificial intelligence to learn your preferred rice texture based on inputs you give it after cooking through each batch of rice. Commerce writer Wilder Davies has been testing the NW-JEC10 for over a year, and has come around to the view that the My Rice functionality is no gimmick. He found that his batches of rice evolved for the better over time as he gave the machine more feedback (specifically, it will ask you to input whether the stickiness and firmness of the previous batch you made was “not enough,” “okay,” or “too much”). What’s more, this rice won its initial taste test with our staffers. But the difference in rice quality was not enough to merit the $750 price tag, hence our recommendation for the average rice eater remains the (nearly $450 cheaper) NP-HCC10.  Zojirushi NP-NWC10XB Pressure Induction Heating Rice Cooker Amazon What we think of the Zojirushi NP-NWC10 With Micom technology and induction heating, this model is very similar to our top pick. If you’re wondering why it’s over $100 more expensive, that’s because unlike our winner, it uses pressure when cooking rice. While intended to produce a more tender grain, our testers preferred the rice the NP-HCC10 churned out, deeming the NP-NWC10’s rice a bit soft for their liking when cooked on a standard setting. It’s worth noting that this model allows you to adjust texture and consistency with relative ease, which worked well in our long-term testing, but we cannot recommend you shell out an additional $100+ for it based on its overall performance.  Zojirushi Neuro Fuzzy Rice Cooker, 5.5-Cup, White Amazon What we think of the Zojirushi NS-ZCC10 The Zojirushi NS-ZCC10 didn’t make as nicely textured and fluffy rice as our winning pick. It does include many of the features we loved in our winner at a lower price point, like the intuitive interface, sturdy inner pot, Keep Warm function and array of presets. It also had some additional features our winner lacked, like a retractable cord and handles on the sides of the pot that allow you to lift it out from the cooker while it’s still hot. However, at over $240 at the time of publication, we just don’t think this cooker produced rice that merited the still-high price tag.  Zojirushi Induction Heating Rice Cooker & Warmer NW-QAC10 Amazon Wayfair What we think of the Zojirushi NW-QAC10 This model is part of Zojirushi’s newest line of rice cookers, and looks similar to the pricey NW-JEC10 model we mentioned above. It is similar to our winner in terms of functionality, but couldn’t match up to the NP-HCC10’s results in the white rice test. Our tasters found the rice this model produced to be soft and less intact than they’d have liked. That said, the NW-QAC10 features quinoa and oatmeal settings, which makes it a good rice cooker for anyone with a particular affinity for either of those grains.  Zojirushi 3-Cup Rice Cooker Amazon What we think of the Zojirushi 3-Cup Rice Cooker With a 3-cup capacity, this is the only rice cooker Zojirushi makes that we’d classify as a mini. It’s dead simple, with a single button used to start the cooking process, and didn’t leak starchy water out of the steam vent unlike some other similar models we tested. That said, there were several things that kept this cooker out of the running: It produced inconsistent results, making great rice sometimes and over or undercooked rice others. It also lacks a Keep Warm function, and we found it didn’t handle brown rice well.  Zojirushi NS-TSC10A Micom Rice Cooker and Warmer Amazon Target Wayfair What we think of the Zojirushi NS-TSC10A This model is similar to our top pick in design and functionality, but rings in at about $100 cheaper. The main reason for that is likely that it lacks the induction heating capabilities of the NP-HCC10. While it produced good rice across all of our tests, it never quite achieved as perfectly-textured results as our winner. Our testers found the rice to be a bit too soft across the board (though this could be remedied by adding a bit less water than the recommended amount). We did, however, appreciate the retractable cord—plus the silver and light grey design is rather chic.  Toshiba 6 Cup Rice Cooker with Fuzzy Logic Amazon Wayfair What we think of the Toshiba TRCS01 This model performed exceedingly well in our initial blind taste test, producing fluffy grains that won over our testers. We also loved its suite of programmable features, the way it gave us a timer countdown from the start of cooking as well as the option to delay cooking until later, its audible alarm, and its use of fuzzy logic to make minute temperature and time adjustments according to real time sensor feedback (something more typically seen in higher priced models). We found it easy to use, with helpful presets for a range of rice types and a quick rice function that worked well for grains like quinoa, farro, and polenta, and an included steamer basket. But our long-term testing of this product revealed a major flaw: We found that the timer would repeatedly freeze (sometimes for 20 minutes or longer) while the machine continued to cook. This issue was particularly prevalent when using the multi grain and quick rice settings. It’s worth noting that the timer function on a rice cooker is typically more of an approximation, and it’s not uncommon for it to change or stall momentarily—but not to this extent. It resulted in overcooked or even burned grains. It was not a consistent problem, but a problem nonetheless, and a big enough one to give us pause about recommending this model as our top budget pick.  Toshiba Small 3 Cup Rice Cooker Amazon What we think of the Toshiba TRCS02 This rice cooker from Toshiba is not a newer version of the TRCS01 referenced above, but rather a smaller model with a 3-cup capacity we’d classify as mini. While it has some of the same features such as fuzzy logic technology and a delay start option, it has a different array of presets from the other Toshiba that includes things like “Cake,” “Egg,” and “Slow Cook.” It fared relatively well in the white rice portion of our taste test, but produced overcooked brown rice that kept it from earning a top spot.  TIGER JBV-A10U 5.5-Cup Micom Rice Cooker with Food Steamer Basket Amazon Walmart What we think of the Toshiba JBV-A10U This former best budget pick is made by Tiger, another Japan-based company with over 100 years of history making many of the same kinds of products Zojirushi does. It's one of the most affordable Micom models out there, ringing in at $99 (at the time of writing). And while it doesn’t have all the fancy bells and whistles of the Zojirushi, it still makes consistently great rice. In our blind taste tests, staffers picked the Tiger over several more expensive models. We also loved this cooker's generous 5.5-cup (uncooked) capacity and that it's intuitive to use, easy to clean, and offers something a step above a simple one-button, non-Micom model. This is still a dead simple, no-frills rice cooker. You get what you pay for: There is no alarm, timer, or digital interface, and fewer settings than you’ll get on something like our winning Zojirushi or some of the fancier Tiger models. In our most recent round of testing, the Hamilton Beach model edged it out by producing slightly better rice and having more helpful features, all while ringing in at practically half the price.  Tiger JAX-T10U Rice Cooker Amazon What we think of the Tiger JAX-T10U This model from Tiger is similar to some of the Zojirushi and Toshiba models we tested in terms of preset options and general functionality. It has a 5.5-cup uncooked capacity, ten different menu settings for various types of rice and cooking functions (like steam and synchro), and uses the same kind of Micom technology as we’ve seen in other high-end rice cookers. Despite its promising features, this model produced white rice that was a bit wet and soft for our testers’ liking. The brown rice had a nice bite to it, but its exterior was a tad mushy. Overall, we found that even the budget pick Tiger above, the JBV-A10U, outperformed this more expensive model.  Tiger JKT-D10U 5.5-Cup IH Rice Cooker Amazon What we think of the Tiger JKT-D10U This model performed very similarly to our winning pick from Zojirushi, scoring just a few points below it in our taste test. It has a 5.5-cup uncooked capacity, a sturdy nonstick inner pot with handles for safely lifting it out of the machine while hot, and all the other features we’d expect from a rice cooker with its price tag: A bevy of settings (12 to be exact), automatic logic technology, an audible chime, and automatic keep warm functionality. It produced beautifully cooked white rice that was nearly on par with the Zojirushi NP-HCC10, but fell a bit more short in the brown rice test, where the grains were on the mushier side. All in all, it’s a great rice cooker that any home cook would be happy to use, but for just a few dollars more we’d recommend you go with our winning pick from Zojirushi.  Tiger JNP-1800-FL 10-Cup Rice Cooker Amazon What we think of the Tiger JNP-1800-FL This is a straightforward, single button rice cooker that makes enough rice for the whole family (and a large one at that). Unfortunately, the rice it produced proved some of the softest of the bunch, and while that could potentially be remedied by playing around with the water to rice ratio, the lack of features and subpar taste test performance meant we just weren’t wowed by this appliance enough to recommend it to anyone.  Cuckoo 6-Cup Rice Cooker and Warmer Amazon What we think of the Cuckoo CR-0655F This model from Cuckoo is a great rice cooker for the price. Tasters ranked the rice it made nearly as highly as our winning Zojirushi, which is a feat considering the Cuckoo is a third of the price. It’s also much faster than the Zojirushi, clocking in at 15 minutes less, and a bit larger, with a 6-cup capacity. Why didn’t it take the top spot, you might ask? A couple reasons: The lid jerks open with so much force that it can knock the whole appliance off the counter (as well as any objects surrounding it), and it doesn’t have a countdown for the total cook time.  Cuckoo 6-Cup Heating Pressure Rice Cooker CRP-P0609S Amazon What we think of the Cuckoo CR-0675F This Cuckoo suffered some of the same design flaws as the CR-0655F (namely, a lid that aggressively jerks open, and a lack of a countdown timer for the total cook time). We were excited about this model's pressure cooking capabilities and might have excused its design flaws if it had topped our taste tests, but it didn't move past the initial white rice round. The rice it made was incredibly sticky. We also didn't find the control panel intuitive to use.  CUCKOO 6-Cup Rice Cooker Amazon What we think of the Cuckoo CR-0675F This model is like a redesigned, modernized version of the CR-0655F, and makes similarly great rice. However, it too suffers from design flaws in the form of unresponsive buttons and a counterintuitive interface. The manual wasn’t much help either, as its English translation was unclear and hard to follow. So while this cooker checks the “Makes Great Rice” box, the same cannot be said for the “Is a Joy to Use” box.  CUCKOO 6-Cup Twin Pressure Rice Cooker & Warmer Amazon What we think of the Cuckoo CRP-ST0609F This is another modern-looking model from Cuckoo that has many of the same flaws as the CR-0675F—most importantly, the irritatingly unresponsive control panel. It also talks, and in a voice that can only be described as Barbie DreamHouse-core—which may be amusing to some, but aggravating to others. Like the other Cuckoos, it made decent rice, but even the most perfect rice wouldn’t cancel out the downsides we found with this model.  GreenPan Elite Ceramic Nonstick Induction Rice Cooker Amazon What we think of the GreenPan Elite 8-Cup Induction Rice Cooker The vast majority of rice cookers featured pots coated with a nonstick material called PTFE, more commonly known as Teflon. There is ongoing research into the safety of PFAS, the group of chemicals PTFE belongs to, though it’s worth noting that the concerns surrounding them are more relevant for nonstick skillets, which are heated to high temperatures and more likely to be scratched than the pot of a rice cooker. But we are now regularly on the lookout for opportunities to move away from PFAS, so we tested a few options for PTFE-free nonstick rice cookers for people who’d like to avoid PFAS when possible. This model from GreenPan is the best option for a nonstick, PTFE-free rice cooker we’ve found to date. It had fuzzy logic capabilities and a keep warm setting, plus a steamer basket that fits in its ceramic nonstick interior. It was also one of the faster rice cookers we tested, producing totally acceptable white rice in about 25 minutes, and decent brown rice in about 50. This rice cooker does, however, have amongst the fewest setting of the models we tested around this price point, a smaller capacity than the 5.5-cup Zojirushi (because GreenPan measures cups by the amount of cooked rice rather than uncooked), and made rice that, while adequate, didn’t knock our socks off.  GreenPan Bistro 8 Cup Traditional Rice Cooker Amazon What we think of the GreenPan Bistro 8 Cup Traditional Rice Cooker This model is another PTFE-free option that’s similar to the GreenPan above, but fared markedly worse in our testing. We found every batch of rice was burned on the bottom, and that the keep warm setting didn’t do a great job of keeping the rice fresh—it was prone to yellowing and drying out within minutes.  Cosori 5-Quart Rice Cooker Cosori What we think of the Cosori 5-Cup Rice Cooker Cosori makes some of our favorite air fryers, so we were hopeful that their first entry into the rice cooker space would follow suit. In the end, we gave this cooker a passing grade, but it’s nothing to write home about. Standard settings produced rice that was a bit undercooked according to most of our testers, though those who prefer their rice on the al dente side may appreciate this. This machine does have a whopping 18 settings, including a range of different grains, so it could be a decent option for anyone who frequently cooks steel-cut oats, barley, farro, and the like.  KitchenAid Grain and Rice Cooker Kitchen Aid Amazon What we think of the KitchenAid Rice and Grain Cooker This recently-launched model from KitchenAid has a unique design that comprises an integrated scale and attached water tank. It uses that scale and whichever of the 21 preset functions you’ve chosen to determine how much water to add, eliminating the need to futz around with measuring cups and ratios. While it’s an interesting concept, we weren’t impressed enough by this model’s performance to recommend it. The first batch of white rice we made was painfully dry, though the second batch we made using the “softer” setting was an improvement. The brown rice was serviceable, nicely textured if still a touch dry. We spent time in 2025 testing its other capabilities as well and found them hit or miss. You can check out our complete KitchenAid rice cooker review here.  Aroma Mi 3-Cup Rice Cooker Wayfair What we think of the Aroma Mi The Aroma Mi was a pleasant surprise: Despite its cutesy logo and unassuming appearance, it’s a great little rice cooker. It made fluffy rice and had a few handy features that we loved, like a side-locking lid, handles for toting it around, and buttons for both white and brown rice. We also appreciated the loud beep it emits to let you know your rice is done, and the fact that it automatically switches to a keep warm setting after cooking. If you’re looking for an affordable small-capacity rice cooker, this is a great option.  Aroma 4 Cup Digital Rice Cooker Amazon What we think of the Aroma Digital Rice Cooker ARC-914SBD This affordable 4-cup rice cooker from Aroma performed well in the white rice test, producing rice that struck a nice balance in terms of doneness, neither overly mushy nor too hard. If anything, it was a touch on the soft side. The brown rice test was a different story. It was quite literally a hot mess, leaking starchy water onto a divot on the cooker’s lid that would have spilled everywhere had we not mopped it up. The rice itself was wet and oh-so-mushy.  Aroma 2.5-Cup Rice Cooker Amazon What we think of the Aroma 2.5-Cup Rice Cooker ARC-753SG This model from Aroma is another simple, one-button cooker that’s similar in look and function to the Zojirushi 3-cup model, but with a stainless steel inner pot that we found difficult to clean. It made white rice in near record time (20 minutes or so), but it tended to be a bit underdone. The same can be said for its performance in the brown rice test—the rice was good, but certainly not great. This model also exhibited some leakage through the steam vent even when just cooking one cup of rice, which we imagine would only get worse if you filled it to capacity.  Yum Asia Panda Mini Rice Cooker Amazon What we think of the Yum Asia Panda This cooker is a best-seller on Amazon, so we wanted to see what all the fuss was about. We liked that this model is compact in capacity and footprint while still affording you a range of presets to choose from, like long grain, short grain, porridge, and even cake. It remained a promising contender through the first round of taste testing, where it produced excellent white rice. However, like many of the rice cookers on this list, the brown rice test proved to be the Yum Asia Panda’s downfall; the brown rice this model made was overcooked and mushy. As with the Hamilton Beach above, if brown rice isn’t your thing, you might still consider this model.  DASH Mini Rice Cooker Amazon What we think of the DASH Mini Rice Cooker The Dash Mini Rice Cooker is another one-button model like the Zojirushi 3-cup and Aroma 2.5-cup models. However, the lid of this model was too lightweight to stay sealed as steam was trying to escape, therefore allowing much of the heat to escape the pot during cooking.  Cuisinart 4-Cup Rice Cooker Amazon What we think of the Cuisinart 4-Cup Rice Cooker This was another disappointing mini model that didn’t move past the white rice test in our most recent round of testing. The rice it produced looked very wet and undercooked at the time it finished cooking and switched to the keep warm function, and tasted too firm in the middle. This model also came dangerously close to leaking starchy water out of the lid’s steam vent even with just one cup of rice, so we shudder to think of the mess a full four cups would likely make.  Nutribullet EveryGrain Cooker Amazon What we think of the Nutribullet EveryGrain Cooker This cooker has settings for specific grains like white rice, quinoa, and oats, as well as a general “grains” setting, plus other nice-to-have features like a delayed start button and steam option. And while we can’t comment on how this cooker performs with other grains, we can say that it did not fare well with rice. The white rice we made was wildly inconsistent even within the same batch, with some grains emerging too hard and others way too mushy.  What we think of the Instant Pot Duo The beloved Instant Pot Duo is a multi-cooker that claims to do it all—including make rice. It was one of the fastest models to do so, but the grains it produced were probably the worst of the bunch. This cooker didn’t move past the white rice round because the rice in question was gummy and decidedly un-fluffable. You’re better off using the Instant Pot’s pressure cooker function to make a hearty stew, and using a dedicated rice cooker to make a pot of rice to go with it.

TITLE: The Best Kitchen Trash Cans for Keeping Your Kitchen Clean and Gross Smells at Bay
DATE: March 3, 2025
CONTENT:
All products are independently selected by our editors. If you buy something, we may earn an affiliate commission. Unless you’re one of those zero-waste people who keeps all their waste inside a small mason jar, there’s a good chance that you have one or several garbage bins around the house—and the kitchen trash can is perhaps the most essential. And sure, a household item that basically serves as purgatory for food scraps, crumpled-up paper towels, unrecyclable packaging, and whatever else you need to inevitably transport to the garbage can in the garage doesn’t seem like the most exciting purchase you will make for the home. But a high-quality trash can—especially if you have a small kitchen where that trash can can’t hide—is a good investment that will last you a long time. Below you’ll find out top pick for the best kitchen trash can, as well as other models we tested.  Kohler 13-Gallon Step Can Kohler Amazon Fresh: Good-looking, soft close, lid locks for bag change
Stale: Lid can stick if not kept clean What we love: While it was a very close race for best trash can, when all the testing was done we preferred the Kohler step-on model. The can is chic and unobtrusive and has a handsome, brushed stainless-steel finish (it comes in seven other finishes, including black stainless and options with copper accents). The design quality is evident in the details—its lid opens and closes softly no matter how hard you step on the pedal, and the rim locks into place on its own when you lift it up, making it easy to change out the bag. The Kohler’s removable inner bucket has a small hole in the back that allows you to twist and tuck the bag tightly inside and secure it with minimal unsightly overhang. It’s a simple design feature that many trash cans inexplicably lack. Importantly, this is an attractive stainless-steel step trash can (and at 13 gallons you will probably see it). The Kohler also feels built to last, and it has stood up to daily use for over five years now, without malfunction or noticeable wear. What we’d leave: There have been some reports that the outer rim of the bin will get stuck to the top lid and then fall down with a loud bang. We noticed this a couple times when something sticky was on the rim. Keeping the trash can clean will keep this from happening. Specs Size: 26.5" x 16.75" x 13"Style: Step-on trash canColors/finishes: 7Warranty: 10 years  Simplehuman 50-Liter Rectangular Kitchen Step Trash Can Amazon Fresh: Contains odors well, quiet open and close, works with any standard trash bag
Stale: Lid doesn't automatically lock in place, What we love: This Simplehuman trash can came in a close second. It has most of the same features we love about the Kohler: It is solidly built and good-looking, and it opens and closes silently, contains odors to keep your kitchen from getting too smelly, and, despite the fact that Simplehuman produces its own line of trash bags, works fine with any grocery store bag you want to use. Simplehuman’s cans also come in several additional sizes if you need something bigger or smaller for your space. What we’d leave: The Simplehuman bin fell short on a couple small details. You need to flick a little red switch to hold the lid up when changing the bag (the Kohler just locks nicely into place when you lift it), and the stainless-steel exterior, despite being labeled “fingerprint-resistant,” is more prone to smudges and streaks. Specs Size: 25.7" x 19.8" x 12.8"Style: Step-on trash canColors/finishes: Stainless steelWarranty: 10 years After testing trash cans across a range of price points, we ultimately came to the conclusion that spending a little more on a nicer kitchen trash can is worth it in the long run. This is especially true if you have spacial limitations that require you to keep your trash can out on display. Plastic trash cans tend to have flimsy builds, do a poor job at containing odors, and are lousy at keeping trash bags secure. This is something you’ll use constantly, every single day and you will notice the problems with a subpar can pretty quickly. We started by investigating the overall build of the trash cans, taking note of their sturdiness and build quality. We stepped on the foot pedals repeatedly to see if they how they tolerated excessive use. After that we inserted a standard garbage bag into each bin to see how easy they were to secure in place. Then we dropped a 10-pound bag of potatoes in each trash can to see how well-secured the bags were. For odor, we placed a scented air freshener inside each can and left them in a conference room for an hour before returning. This test revealed how easily scents escaped from the trash bins as well as where the smells emanated from. In general, stainless-steel trash cans are superior to plastic at containing smells. So if you weren’t picking them for looks, you might want to for their odor prevention. Following these initial tests, we had staffers take home trash cans for long-term observational notes. We limited our selection to single compartment 13-gallon trash cans or as close to that volume as a particular brand produced. That size seems to be the general industrial standard for household trash can size. We chose to exclude touchless, motion sensor trash cans because they require electricity, are prone to malfunctioning, and are easier for pets to get into with their touch tops. We also excluded dual compartment trash cans with recycling bins because they almost always have a single compartment counterpart that is functionally the same in every other way, so testing both felt redundant. Our top pick from Kohler, for example, comes as a dual compartment can as well. How well does it secure the bag? We looked for trash bins that made it easy to secure the bag inside without risk of it coming loose. While some brands design specially made bags for their trash cans, we think that the best kitchen trash can should be able to accommodate any old store-bought trash bag. Does it keep odors at bay? While it’s generally a good idea to take your trash out often in order to avoid smells, we figured that a good trash can would be able to contain at least a couple days of funk. Some offer odor control scent absorbers, but we find that these seldom work that well. How easy is it to clean? Higher-end trash cans tend to have a removable inner bucket that can be removed and cleaned in the event of an accidental mess. These models are easier to clean, and prevent the external body and the internal mechanics from getting gunk on them.  Simplehuman 55 Liter Rectangular Hands-Free Kitchen Step Trash Can Amazon Simplehuman This isn’t a bad trash can and has many similar features to the Kohler, however a large pocket in the back meant for storing additional liners left a large gap into the trash can, where smells could easily escape.  Brabantia New Icon Step Trash Can, 8 Gallon with Removable Bucket Amazon Brabantia, like Simplehuman, designs proprietary trash bags that fit perfectly into their own bins. Unlike Simplehuman's, Brabantia’s cans don’t accommodate generic trash bags very well, as they lack any method for securing. Since we think a good trash can should be able to hold any trash bag, and not just a brand’s specific bag, we can’t recommend it.  Ikea Mjösa Trash Can Ikea We appreciated the soft close lid and the removable insert, however the build on this wastebasket felt a bit cheap and it lacked an easy way to secure the bags.  Glad 13 Gallon Trash Can Amazon This is a pretty basic budget plastic trash can. It has a reasonably sturdy step pedal, but does a poor job at holding on to trash bags, which slipped off the rim as the bag filled up. It lacks a removable insert, so any leaks or messes that might happen would have to be cleaned directly out of the can.  Rubbermaid Premium Slow Close Step-On Wastebasket Walmart Another black plastic trash can, this one performed similarly to the Glad can, which is to say: It wasn’t great. While it has two movable arms for securing the trash bag, we found that the bag still slipped off when full.  Umbra Brim 13 Gallon Trash Can with Lid Amazon This plastic bin balloons when it gets full, doesn’t hold on to bags well, and can’t contain smells.

TITLE: 10 Australian Wines We’ll Be Sipping All Year
DATE: March 5, 2025
CONTENT:
Between 1990 and 2004, the volume of Aussie wine exported to the US exploded, from around 550,000 annual cases to a whopping 20 million, led by “critter” wine brand Yellow Tail and its many cheap and cheerful companions—as well as pricier balls-to-the-wall reds like Mollydooker. The latter were showered with lofty point scores by renowned American critics of the time, who had a penchant for “bigger is better” wine styles that rarely lived up to the hype. Soon Aussie critter wines—popular wine labels depicting cute animals—had competition from elsewhere in the world and a price war ensued, which Australia couldn’t win. Worth about $718 million at its peak in 2007, Aussie wines sales now account for just $202 million in the US. However, thanks to a small but mighty group of passionate specialist importers, there are more interesting and delicious Australian wines on American shores than ever before. Australia boasts some of the world’s oldest vines and wines; generally very good farming practices; living wages and fair conditions for vineyard workers; and a breadth of wines from over 160 varieties to suit all palates. Australian bottles fall somewhere in the middle of the price spectrum (relatively reasonable when taking into account the country’s steep production and labor costs). At retail, most worth drinking cost upward of $20; a good deal of small-batch, thoughtfully farmed wines come in between $25 to $35, while premium cellar-​worthy bottles may set you back anywhere from $50 to $200 a pop. Compared to the eye-watering price tags of similar fine wines in more coveted French and California regions, they’re a bargain. Bonus: The vast majority of Aussie wines are sealed with screw caps, regardless of price, which equals consistency, longer aging, and zero risk of cork taint. 1. 2023 Vasse Felix Filius Chardonnay, Margaret River, Western Australia, $28 Chardonnay is one of Australia’s unsung heroes, striking a balance between age-worthiness and margarita-like drinkability. Few regions do Chardy like Margaret River, where proximity to the Indian Ocean provides crackling acidity, and abundant sunshine equals generosity of fruit. From the region’s oldest producer, Filius comforts like a favorite T-shirt, with flavors of bright, fleshy lime, flower blossom, nougat, and seashells. Expect a whisper of toasty oak and cream. 2. 2022 Giant Steps Applejack Pinot Noir, Yarra Valley, Victoria, $90 Australians take Pinot Noir very seriously, particularly in cool climate regions like the Yarra Valley. Giant Steps is highly lauded, and thanks to American ownership, a fair amount is exported Stateside. Aussie Pinots are generally fruity and light-to-medium bodied, but the best, like Applejack, offer layers of other flavors, along with cat’s-tongue-soft tannins, that are food-friendly now. If you’re looking to collect age-worthy pours, Giant Steps is a good place to start. 3. 2022 Unico Zelo Esoterico skin contact white blend, Riverland and Clare Valley, South Australia, $28 If skin-contact whites, a.k.a. orange wines, are your bag, pour this wine in your glass, pronto. A blend of aromatic varieties, it’s naturally made (sans funk) by highly ethical winemakers and is a low-alcohol 10.5% to boot. It tastes of musky botanic notes of flowers, ginger, honeycomb, and candied citrus with just enough of pithy tannin for a pleasant grip in the mouth. 4. 2018 Syrahmi XV Shiraz, Heathcote, Victoria, $60 One of Victoria’s many excellent under-the-radar wine regions, Heathcote’s dramatic, boulder-strewn landscape is virtually prehistoric. The area is known for powerful yet fresh perfumed Shiraz, and this is a top example. Think berry cordial, dried violet, mint, and baking spice aromas with chiseled, powdery tannins with a Goldilocks weight—not too heavy, not too light. It’s a far cry from the overblown Shiraz of the past. 5. 2023 Dr. Edge Tyrannosaurus Dredge Pinot Meunier, Tasmania, $44 Peter Dredge is an Aussie wine rock star, and Tasmania is one of the nation’s coolest—both literally and figuratively—regions, famed for top-notch sparkling wine and Pinot Noir. This Pinot Meunier (the lesser known of the Champagne grape varieties) may be a rare bird, but stylistically it exemplifies the “new” Australia, with a pop of berry fruit, florals, and spice amid a satiny, fresh palate. The perfect chillable red. 6. 2022 Delinquente Hell Nero d’Avola, Riverland, South Australia, $30 In a region as hot as Riverland, drought-tolerant Southern Italian varieties like Nero d’Avola thrive. Many winemakers, like Con-Greg Grigoriou of Delinquente, believe these varieties are the future of the country’s warmest wine regions. This bottle is part of a colorful range that exemplifies this shift. Remarkably vivacious, it evokes wild Aussie springtime flowers, blueberry and rhubarb crumble, and savory spice. 7. 2022 Harkham Aziza Sémillon, Hunter Valley, New South Wales, $40 Hunter Valley has been making unique, long-lived Sémillon for nearly 200 years. Harkham’s version is made in a natural, zero-sulfur-added vein, so it walks to its own beat. Wild but not funky thanks to a palate of wildflowers, beeswax, lemon balm, and hay, it’s waxy-textured with a ping of pithy, lemony acidity. Plus, it’s just 10.7% alcohol and keeps improving days after opening. 8. 2023 Ochota Barrels The Price of Silence Gamay, Adelaide Hills, South Australia, $60 Adelaide Hills was ground zero for the country’s natural wine movement, home to a plethora of creative small-batch producers like winemaker Taras Ochota, who led the charge. After his untimely death in 2020, his wife, Amber, took the reins, and wine quality hasn’t suffered. Like everything in the Ochota range, this Gamay is fresh and perfumed, evocative of site and variety. 9. 2022 Thistledown The Vagabond Old Vine Grenache, McLaren Vale, South Australia, $58 If you find Shiraz too rich, then mid-weight Grenache is a step in the lighter direction. McLaren Vale is the variety’s spiritual home Down Under, with gnarly old vines and producers like Thistledown skilled at coaxing out Grenache’s plump berry, floral, and white pepper perfume and satiny texture. 10. 2023 Grosset Springvale Riesling, Clare Valley, South Australia, $38 Clare Valley and Riesling go together like cats and naps. The Aussie style is typically bone-dry with rapier-sharp acidity, chalk-dust texture, and delicate citrus and floral flavors. This version, from arguably Australia’s most renowned Riesling producers, is exemplary. It could age for decades, but is beautiful now, especially for the acid hounds among us.

TITLE: How to Safely Use Expired Milk
DATE: March 5, 2025
CONTENT:
It’s no secret grocery prices have climbed in the last few years, and milk is no exception. In these inflated conditions, you may find yourself clamoring to finish a carton before its expiration date, to avoid pouring what might as well be liquid cash down the drain. But here’s some good news: You don’t have to toss out your milk just because it’s past its expiration date. If you observe a few precautions, you can safely consume that expired milk. After all, an expiration date is essentially an educated guess from the manufacturer. Milk may last days beyond its predicted shelf life when stored below 40℉ (4℃). “It’s certainly possible milk might look, taste, and smell just fine, even after the expiration date,” Donald Schaffner, PhD, a food science professor at Rutgers University tells me. And according to official guidance from the US Department of Agriculture, “if the [expiration] date passes during home storage, a product should still be safe and wholesome if handled properly until the time spoilage is evident.” If your milk doesn’t smell or look funky after the stamped expiration date has passed, it’s likely safe to consume. If you want to be extra cautious, says Schaffner, boil it before putting it to another use. In any case, you’ll want to use it as quickly as possible, before the narrow window between usable and actively spoiled (see: funky) passes. Wary of pouring it straight up into your next bowl of cereal? Cooking or baking with expired milk (in recipes that reach 165℉ or above) are both efficient means of using up the stuff and killing any bacteria in the process. Put that half-gallon toward a cake, a creamy soup, or perhaps a tray of muffins for Sunday brunch. Make dulce de leche from scratch. Live a little and braise some pork in it! If you can’t find an immediate use, freeze it in portions to call upon for soups or baking projects to come. Spoiled milk is not synonymous with sour milk. While certain bacteria can cause milk to turn sour (that is, to turn acidic and curdle, similar to recipes that instruct you to add a splash of vinegar to fresh milk), “spoiled milk” may carry any number of contaminants. According to Schaffner, there’s no way to know what they are without proper testing. Often, milk is spoiled by a microorganism called Pseudomonas, which “does not really lead to souring,” Schaffner tells me, ”but more so to off flavors.” Long story short: It’ll simply taste gross. That’s why we can’t recommend using spoiled milk as a buttermilk substitute, as some other outlets might. Unless you know what you’re working with, you could end up with some pretty gnarly biscuits. One potential beneficiary of your expired milk? Your garden. Plants love to soak up calcium as much as our bones do, and milk’s antifungal properties are thought to mitigate mildew in your outdoor garden too. The Spruce suggests mixing surplus milk with water in a 1:1 solution, pouring it into a spray bottle, and applying it sparingly to the leaves of your plant or the soil immediately surrounding it. Fortifying your plants and eliminating food waste in the process? A win-win, we’d say. So, before you dump your dairy, eyes averted from the scene of the crime, consider the potential in that gallon. Your wallet, your cake, and your plants will thank you.

ON THIS WEEK’S episode of Dinner SOS, test kitchen director and host Chris Morocco is joined by Dan Pelosi, author of the cookbook Let’s Eat: 101 Recipes to Fill Your Heart & Home, to assist Liliana in making meals that can feed a crowd (while satisfying her family’s many dietary restrictions). Liliana lives with her husband and two sons who are recent college graduates. One of her sons has a dairy allergy and can’t eat salmon; Liliana has an issue with sodium; and vegetables like brussels sprouts, asparagus, avocado, and peas are not fan favorites. Her first thought is that she needs one-pot casseroles she can make-ahead and don’t require much cleanup. Most essential of all is finding protein-heavy dishes that are frankly geared towards carnivores since that is what her sons mainly crave. Chris recruits Dan Pelosi, also known as GrossyPelosi on Instagram, who grew up in an Italian-Portuguese family and is no stranger to feeding a crowd. Because casseroles can be dairy-heavy, Chris and Dan both lean into slow-cooking meaty braises. Dan suggests his Early Dismissal Pot Roast, a recipe in his cookbook that’s all made in one pot, requires only 20 minutes of active cooking, and then roasts slowly in the oven for three to four hours. It also reheats really well the next day, which means it’s a perfect domino dinner—a brilliant term that Liliana uses to describe recipes that yield leftover protein to use in stir-fries, fried rice, or empanadas all week long. Chris also suggests a braise that cooks all day in the oven after an overnight marinade—this Burnt Orange and Coriander Roast Pork. Listen now to hear which protein packed recipe Liliana chooses to make to feed her hungry family.

TITLE: I Tried a Dozen Dish Drying Racks—And This One Is Clearly the Best
DATE: March 6, 2025
CONTENT:
All products are independently selected by our editors. If you buy something, we may earn an affiliate commission. It’s time for you dishwasher people to face a hard truth: Some things just have to be washed by hand. If this is already obvious to you, good for you. However, I’ve encountered far too many people in my life who shove absolutely anything and everything in the dishwasher, willfully ignoring the impact that the heat coils and detergent (dish soap and dish detergent are not the same!) have on their cookware. If you are someone who uses nonstick pans, wood utensils, stainless steel, cast iron, insulated mugs, high-end chef’s knives, fine stemware and wants that stuff to actually last, you gotta get to scrubbing! Once you accept this reality, you’ll come to understand why having a dish drying rack next to your sink is a real asset. Having a designated place on the kitchen counter to stack up hand-washed dishes so that they can properly air-dry before going back to their storage spots makes washing dishes by hands much less of a headache. It will make your life easier and help you take better care of your things, plain and simple. Below you’ll find our reviews of the best dish drying racks. We picked a favorite, but this is a product category with a lot of good options out there, and a lot of what makes a good dish rack depends on your particular needs and space constraints, so we encourage you to check out the other options too.  Joseph Joseph Dish Rack Amazon What we love: The Joseph Joseph Expandable Dish Rack is versatile and adaptable to different spaces in a way that no other countertop dish racks were. While no dish rack is perfect, we appreciated this one’s modular design and found that it worked well, even with a wide array of space constraints. The real standout feature of the Joseph Joseph is its ability to expand and contract, allowing you to adjust the dish rack to a size that suits you. You can orient the drain spout to any side, which gives you some additional flexibility in the ways you fill the rack. In our test, we were able to fit dishes, utensils, pots, and glassware from a dinner for four without issue, and the rack is sturdy enough to withstand the weight of heavier things like Dutch ovens. Rather than having raised parallel ridges for holding dishes, this rack has taller, narrow, rubber-tipped arches that enables dish stacking in two different directions, more akin to the racks inside a dishwasher. The whole thing comes apart quite easily for cleaning as well—the two main components slide apart and the metal rack can be removed for a wipe down when needed. This is a clever space-saving design that would be at home in a variety of kitchen setups, and it can stow more easily than any other caddy-style dish rack we tested. What we’d leave: As is the case with any dish rack with a drainage spout, there’s potential for it to get a little funky, but the spout is easy enough to remove from the bottom to clean things out. We also wish it had a swivel spout instead of one that snapped into place, just for added flexibility. Specs Size: Closed: 14" x 6.5" x 12.25", Open: 14" x 6.5" x 20.25"Material: Stainless steel, plasticAdjustable: YesIn sink: NoFeatures: Removable utensil holder with knife slots, adjustable drain spout, raised cup drying mat Our first test for these dish racks was to see how well they cleared water by pouring water around the drainage area. We did this several times at different speeds and with different volumes of water to see if we could suss out any flaws or leaky areas. In general, we found that most could clear a heavy flow fine, but lighter drips (which are much more likely from drying dishes) tended to stick around on all of them until they evaporated. Our second test involved testing capacity and stability by filling each rack up with dishes. For our test we used: four large dinner plates, four drinking glasses, four sets of flatware, A 5-qt. Dutch oven, and a 10" frying pan. Separately, we tested each rack out to see how well they handled bowls, specifically whether the design made it possible to rack them up standing up or if you had to place them down flat, which takes up much more space. Adaptability We were most interested in a dish rack’s ability to function under a wide variety of space constraints. We liked the idea of a dish rack that could accommodate different spatial needs and could adapt itself to the given moment. Stationary dish racks can take up a lot of counter space, so a collapsible dish rack or one that could otherwise stow away or be easily moved was a strong contender in our eyes. Easy to clean Even if you do a good job of hand-drying, a dish rack is still a pretty wet environment, and it can get funky and gross, which is why having one that is easy to clean and disassemble is a huge must. You should expect that a dish rack is something you clean on a fairly regular basis, so the easier it is to do that, the better. We also gave positive marks to anything with rustproof or rust-resistant features. Versatility We were less concerned with how much stuff could fit in the dish rack than we were with how many ways things could fit in a dish rack. A design that lends itself to a variety of orientations and can support all kinds of dishes in the same space is better than a dish rack that has a bunch of separate, specifically designated sections for things at the cost of taking up more room.  KitchenAid Dish Rack Amazon This is a favorite dish rack among many review sites, and we liked it too. Just not as much as the Joseph Joseph. It has a sturdy stainless-steel build and a smart design with a simple slide out drip tray, making it very easy to clean. Our only gripe with it is that you can’t control the direction of the drip tray angles. This means that it has to sit on your countertop at its widest orientation, making this an impractical choice for people short on counter space. When choosing a winner, we wanted to pick something that would provide greater adaptability (people move, kitchen setups change). However, if you have the space to accommodate this rack, it’s a great choice.  Simple Human Dish Drying Rack Amazon As to be expected with a Simple Human product, this dish rack is thoughtfully designed with unique features. It has a rack for hanging stemware and a hydrophilic coating on the basin that spreads water out for faster evaporation. This is the largest dish rack we tested, so if this is what you want, be sure you have plenty of room for it. We would have liked more pegs for supporting dishes upright. Also the drain was a bit difficult to clean compared to other dish racks. If you find yourself hand-washing a lot of wine glasses, this might be your model of choice, though. Overall, this is a high-quality stainless-steel dish rack that is worth it if you have the space.  Kitsure Dish Rack Amazon This was one of the more affordable dish racks we found. It can function on the countertop, suspend over the kitchen sink, or sit inside it. It has a plastic drainage base and a wire metal construction that’s easy to clean, and it could hold all the dishes required in our test. The materials felt a little cheap, though, making us wonder about its longevity. Longer testing is needed for us to potentially rate it higher, but overall this is a good, versatile choice.  Umbra Sink Dish Drying Rack Amazon Like the Kitsure, this is a versatile caddy designed to either go in the sink, suspend over it, or, theoretically, sit next to it (although it doesn’t have any base for that). It is pretty affordable and has a modest but workable capacity. Some buyers have complained about the feet rusting, which is worth noting. It would also be great if it came with an optional drain board like the Kitsure. But, alas…  Oxo Good Grips Foldaway Dish Rack Amazon We appreciated the attempt at making a dish rack that folds up when not in use, but the plastic components were bulky and rigid and had to be forced open. We also found this one tricky to clean due to an abundance of nooks and crannies.  Oxo Good Grips Aluminum Dish Rack Amazon We weren’t crazy about the plastic ridges on this dish rack, which we felt were unnecessarily bulky. The design also felt cramped compared to other models we tested.  Brabantia Large Dish Drying Rack Amazon The problems with this dish rack are that it lacked sides, which are helpful for providing additional support when piling dishes high, and that the drip tray was not very effective at containing moisture. To use this dish rack, we’d recommend placing a towel underneath it to avoid any messes. It was, at least, one of the easiest dish racks to clean.  Boon Lawn Countertop Amazon We appreciate this as a playful and clever kitchen gadget, but ultimately this dish rack is best used for bottles and small kitchen accessories. It isn’t particularly helpful for dishes and larger pots.  Gir Over the Sink Dish Rack Amazon We didn’t love this style of dish rack—a roll-up, over-the-sink dish drainer. They aren’t very versatile and take up a lot of sink space, which should be a deal-breaker if you aren’t working with a double-basin or large single-basin sink.  Dorai Home Dish Pad Amazon If you aren’t familiar with diatomaceous earth dish racks, here’s what you need to know: Diatomaceous earth is a stone material consisting of fossilized microalgae. It has low density and high porosity, which makes it useful for a variety of jobs. In this case, the stone absorbs and dissipates moisture while preventing the growth of microbes. It might be hard to believe, but they really do work well as an alternative to dish towels that are prone to getting mildewy. The Dorai Pad has a pretty simple design, and on its own, it isn’t really a dish rack at all. It is a foldable dish-drying mat that uses its stone base to absorb excess water. It is a superior alternative to a microfiber mats or plastic drip tray, which could be used in conjunction with other dish racks.  Momo Lifestyle Small Dish Drying Rack Amazon This is another Diatomaceous earth drying rack that’s on the smaller side. The pegs and ridges couldn’t really accommodate larger dishes, and it lacked any space for drying utensils, cutting boards, or silverware.
