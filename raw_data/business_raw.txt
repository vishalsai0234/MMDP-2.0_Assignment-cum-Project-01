TITLE: Malaysian Tycoon Lim Han Weng’s HI Mobility Adding Electric Buses With IPO Proceeds
DATE: 
CONTENT:
ByJonathan Burgos , Forbes Staff. HI Mobility's yellow-colored ferry passengers between Malaysia's Johor Bahru and Singapore, ... [+] considered the world's busiest land crossing. HI Mobility—controlled by Malaysian oil and gas tycoon Lim Han Weng—is raising 115.9 million ringgit ($26.3 million) from its IPO to add electric buses to its fleet as the company gears up for increased cross-border traffic at the causeway between Malaysia and Singapore. Under the IPO, HI Mobility is selling 95 million new shares (equivalent to about 19% of the company’s enlarged issued shares) at 1.22 ringgit each, valuing the company at 610 million ringgit. Trading on the Malaysian bourse will start on March 28. Proceeds from the IPO will help fund the company’s fleet expansion, comprising the purchase of 55 new buses, of which 10 will be electric buses, as well as buildout of the company’s electric vehicle charging infrastructure. “What sets us apart from other bus service operators in Malaysia is that we also provide the Johor Bahru-Singapore cross-border bus service,” Lim Chern Chuen, executive director and CEO of HI Mobility, said in a statement. The Johor-Singapore causeway is considered the world’s busiest land border with over 300,000 people passing through the immigration checkpoint daily. HI Mobility is well-positioned to capture increased economic activity in Johor as the area is being jointly developed by Malaysia and Singapore as a special economic zone. “Connectivity and mobility are key enablers of economic development, which HI Mobility has been providing based on its 23-year operating track record,” said Michael Oh-Lau, CEO of Maybank Investment, the IPO’s sole underwriter. The company, which also provides bus services in Melaka and Klang Valley, has an existing fleet of over 550 buses ferrying three million commuters per month. Its net profit increased 73% to 34.6 million ringgit in 2024, according to HI Mobility’s IPO prospectus. HI Mobility will be the third publicly listed company owned by tycoon Lim Han Weng, who is also the controlling shareholder of oil and gas service providers Yinson Holdings and ICON Offshore. Lim and wife Bah Kim Lian, cofounded Yinson Holdings in 1984 as a transport and trading business. It has since grown to become one of the world’s largest oil and gas services companies. In 2020, it diversified into renewable energy and now has solar plants in India and Peru. With a net worth of $405 million, the family ranked no. 45 in Forbes Asia’s list of Malaysia’s richest that was published in April last year.

TITLE: Trump Threatens New Tariffs On Canada As Soon As Today—After Halting 25% Levies
DATE: Mar 7, 2025,
CONTENT:
President Donald Trump said Friday he might impose reciprocal tariffs on some Canadian goods as soon as today, the latest development in his trade war with U.S. neighboring countries after a head-spinning week in which he imposed a 25% tax on Mexican and Canadian goods—then delayed most of the levies for a month. US President Donald Trump speaks from the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, DC, on March ... [+] 7, 2025. (Photo by JIM WATSON/AFP via Getty Images) Trump said Friday from the Oval Office he would target Canadian lumber and dairy products with new tariffs “as early as today” or Monday or Tuesday, accusing the country of “taking advantage of our farmers” by charging steep tariffs on the products coming from the U.S. Trump has long taken issue with the tariffs Canada charges on dairy products—ranging from 241% for fluid milk to 299% for butter, according to Politifact—and said Friday Canada will “be met with the exact same tariff unless they drop it.” The announcement marks yet another turn, in a matter of days, in Trump’s tariff plans: he imposed a 25% tariff on Mexican and Canadian goods on Tuesday, announced an exemption for the auto industry on Wednesday, then on Thursday delayed the taxes until April 2 for products traded under the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement. While Trump has spoken in generally positive terms about his negotiations with Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Trump have exchanged harsh words amid the trade war—Trump accused Trudeau of “using the Tariff problem, which he has largely caused, in order to run again for Prime Minister,” in a Thursday post on Truth Social, while Trudeau has called Trump’s tariffs “very dumb.” A Wednesday phone call between Trudeau and Trump also turned heated, according to The Wall Street Journal, citing an unnamed source who said it included “profanity,” while Trump said the call ended in a “somewhat friendly” manner.

And I don’t know if it’s predictability,” Trump said in an interview with Fox Business released Friday, after host Maria Bartiromo told Trump “I think CEOs want to see predictability” and pressed him for “clarity” on his plans. Trump has cited his desire for more border controls from Mexico, Canada and China plus additional measures to stem the flow of fentanyl into the U.S. in enacting the tariffs. In addition to the back-and-forth over Canadian tariffs, Trump also imposed a new 10% tax on Chinese imports on Tuesday (that he left in place), on top of the 10% levy assessed earlier this year. All three countries said they would take retaliatory measures. Canada announced a 25% tariff on $20.7 billion USD worth of U.S. goods that officials said would stay in place despite Trump’s decision Thursday to delay the taxes for a month, though Canada cancelled a second round of retaliatory tariffs that would have taken effect three weeks later. China said it would increase import duties by 10-15% on several key American agricultural food products and expand export controls on 15 U.S. firms. The three major stock market indexes were on track for their worst weeks this year amid the tariff turmoil and a weaker-than-expected jobs report released Friday.

TITLE: Stocks Suffer Worst Week In 6 Months—Despite Friday Bounce
DATE: Mar 7, 2025,
CONTENT:
A Friday rally was not enough to reverse a brutal start to March for U.S. stocks, as investors digested a barrage of economic data and policies from President Donald Trump, particularly the uncertainty of his extensive tariffs on the country’s top three trade partners. It's a red March thus far in the stock market. The most widely followed American stock index, the S&P 500 (down 3.1% since last Friday) registered its worst weekly losses since the week ending Sept. 6, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (down 2.4%) suffered its worst loss since February. That came even as the Dow rose 0.5%, or 220 points, and the S&P gained 0.6% in Friday trading as February’s jobs report came in just shy of economist forecasts.The S&P closed at its lowest end-of-week level since the week ending Nov. 1, ahead of the election. The S&P closed at its lowest end-of-week level since the week ending Nov. 1, ahead of the election. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite and the Russell 2000, which tracks smaller companies with a median market capitalization of about $1 billion, suffered even bigger percentage losses this week, as the Nasdaq fell 3.5% to its lowest end-of-week price since early October and the Russell sank 3.9% to its lowest level since June. Driving the losses were flipflops from Trump on tariffs, as his 25% levies on Canadian and Mexican goods and 10% additional duty on Chinese imports went into effect Tuesday, before delaying most of the Canadian and Mexican tariffs until April on Thursday, and then teasing new tariffs on some Canadian goods Friday. “I’m not even looking at the market,” Trump said Thursday, before adding there will be “a little short-term interruption.” More than $3 trillion. That’s how much market value has been wiped out from the S&P from its Feb. 19 all-time high, according to FactSet data, as the index fell 6%. In terms of market value lost, Elon Musk’s car company Tesla and artificial intelligence chip designer Nvidia are the two biggest losers dating back to Feb. 19, as Nvidia lost $712 billion in market cap and Tesla $322 billion in that timeframe. In addition to Nvidia and Tesla, a slew of big-name companies suffered 8% or greater stock selloffs this week, including American Express, Bank of America, Boeing, Citigroup, Costco, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley, Netflix and Wells Fargo. Beyond the likely negative impact on corporate earnings, at least in the short term, of tariffs, the constantly shifting tariff implementation dates and exceptions have led to heightened uncertainty, something investors largely despise.  “It seems as if there have been very few times in markets where one has to interpret so much disparate, and at times conflicting, data relative to the economy and influences on it,” Rick Rieder, the head of BlackRock’s global allocation investment team, wrote to clients Friday. Stocks initially soared after Trump’s November win, as the Dow tacked on about 3,000 points in the three weeks after the election, gains spurred by prevailing hopes of corporate tax cuts and more lax regulations, before sentiment soured as Trump enacted his economic agenda. Trump’s “policies appear to be tilting towards a less business-friendly stance,” remarked JPMorgan Chase economists Bruce Kasman and Joseph Lupton in a Friday note. The S&P is down about 4% dating back to Trump’s January inauguration.   One Community. Many Voices. Create a free account to share your thoughts.

TITLE: Elon Musk Dubiously Blames Billionaires George Soros, Reid Hoffman Over Tesla Protests—Citing Unnamed ‘Investigation’
DATE: Mar 8, 2025,
CONTENT:
Elon Musk, the world’s richest man, blamed fellow billionaires George Soros, Reid Hoffman and the ActBlue fundraising organization over recent protests targeting his firm Tesla, citing an “investigation”—though it’s unclear what investigation he’s referencing. Protesters have voiced opposition to Elon Musk's DOGE by demonstrating outside Tesla dealerships. ... [+] (Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images) In a post on X Saturday morning, Musk pointed fingers at Democratic donors, including Soros and Hoffman, as well as the ActBlue organization, Democratic Socialists of America and other Democratic-affiliated groups for being behind recent protests against Tesla. Musk cited an “investigation” finding these groups responsible, but he did not cite any specific investigation, and there is no other evidence linking Soros or Hoffman to the Tesla protests. Musk also misleadingly called these groups “ActBlue-funded,” though ActBlue does not fund groups, but instead is a platform through which donors can give money to campaigns or organizations. Musk reposted a tweet by right-wing influencer Mario Nawfal parroting Musk’s claims about ActBlue, Soros and Hoffman, which vaguely cited X, the New York Post and the conservative outlet BizPac Review as sources, though a BizPac Review article about the protests only cited Musk’s post as a source and articles by the New York Post about Tesla protests do not state who is behind them. Musk’s latest post comes one day after he said, “Something stinks about ActBlue,” in a post on X, which was in response to a user posting about seven ActBlue senior officials resigning at the end of February. Forbes has reached out to ActBlue for comment. Tesla has been targeted by protesters angry at Musk and his Department of Government Efficiency’s effort to slash jobs across the federal government. On Saturday, multiple protesters were arrested outside of a New York City Tesla dealership, some of whom chanted: “We need clean air, not another billionaire,” the New York Post reported. Earlier this week, about 350 protesters chanted, “Elon Musk has got to go,” outside of a Tesla dealership in Portland, Oregon. Last week, protesters at more than 50 Tesla stores across the United States demonstrated to protest Musk, and some of the protests have extended internationally to Barcelona, London and Lisbon, CNN reported. Many of these protests appear to be organized on the “Tesla Takedown” website, which urges protesters to “sell your Teslas, dump your stock, join the picket lines. The “Tesla Takedown” website lists the Troublemakers and Disruption Project organizations as sponsors, two of the groups mentioned in Musk’s Saturday post. “Creating a vote of no confidence in him from the shareholders, that would be the ultimate goal,” Alex Winter, actor and protest organizer, told CNN. Musk is worth an estimated $342.4 billion, according to Forbes estimates, making him the richest person in the world. Much of his wealth comes from his 12% stake in Tesla and his 42% stake in SpaceX, both of which he co-founded. Musk’s net worth is down more than $120 billion from his $464 billion peak in December, as the value of Tesla shares have fallen amid fears over President Donald Trump’s tariffs. ‘Tesla Takedown’ protesters gather outside showrooms to rally against Elon Musk’s role with DOGE (CNN) Elon Musk Is Officially $121 Billion Poorer Than His Peak—As Tesla Stock Erases Most All Of Its Election Rally (Forbes)  One Community.

TITLE: Here’s Where Trump’s Government Layoffs Are Targeted—As NOAA Reportedly Set To Cut 20% Of Staff
DATE: Mar 9, 2025,
CONTENT:
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration is set to lay off approximately 20% of its workforce, The New York Times reported—the latest round of terminations that come after President Donald Trump reportedly told Cabinet secretaries that they, rather than Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, have ultimate authority over their departments’ mass firings. President Donald Trump waves before departing on Marine One from the South Lawn of the White House ... [+] on March 7. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration: The Trump administration has directed NOAA to lay off approximately 1,000 workers on top of 1,300 workers that have already been laid off, The New York Times reported March 8, cutting approximately 20% of the agency’s workforce—which sources cited by the Times feared would affect the agency’s weather forecasting work ahead of hurricane season and other potential natural disasters. Central Intelligence Agency: The agency has started to fire some probationary employees, multiple outlets reported, after firing some diversity staffers last month who had been placed on leave as part of the Trump administration’s push to eliminate diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives across the federal government—it’s unclear what prompted the latest round of firings, but a federal judge ruled last week that CIA Director John Ratcliffe had the authority to fire officers at will. Department of Veterans Affairs: The VA’s chief of staff, Christopher Syrek, reportedly said in an internal memo viewed by the Associated Press the agency is aiming to get down to 2019 staffing levels of around 400,000—which will require removing around 80,000 positions—and officials should prepare for a reorganization in August that will “resize and tailor the workforce to the mission and revised structure.” The reported reorganization comes after the agency announced about 2,400 probationary employees were dismissed in mid-February in two waves. Internal Revenue Service: The IRS was preparing to reduce its nearly 100,000-person workforce by about 50% through layoffs and buyouts, multiple outlets reported Tuesday—news that comes after the Trump administration already laid off about 7,000 IRS workers and reportedly set out to close more than 110 offices in February, at the peak of tax season. USAID: Thousands of employees were reportedly given 15-minute windows on Feb. 27 and 28 to clear their office spaces as the Trump administration has sought to virtually shut down the agency, firing or placing on leave 5,600 workers and freezing foreign assistance from USAID—a directive the Supreme Court has allowed to temporarily continue while it assesses the issue. Social Security Administration: The administration has been instructed to cut its workforce in half, according to The Washington Post, citing unnamed sources who work at the agency. Labor Department: The agency plans to reduce staff in an office that handles equal employment opportunity laws by 90%, The Washington Post reported. Environmental Protection Agency: Trump told reporters during his first Cabinet meeting that EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin has expressed a desire to cut 65% of the EPA’s 18,000-some employees, as the Trump administration seeks to roll back Biden-era environmental protections—but the White House later said the comments were instead referring to a 65% cut in spending. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration: A spokesperson confirmed the agency—which has open safety investigations into Musk’s Tesla company—laid off 4% of its staff in a statement that said the agency grew by 30% during President Joe Biden’s administration, noting it “retained positions critical to the mission of saving lives, preventing injuries, and reducing economic costs due to road traffic crashes.” Federal Emergency Management Agency: The Trump administration has directed senior officials in the FEMA resilience office, which helps communities prepare for potential disasters and mitigate risk, to identify employees who work or worked on “climate, environmental justice, equity and DEIA” initiatives for potential firings, CNN reported, citing an email sent to the resilience office officials that said the directive could “impact the majority” of staff, as Trump has suggested previously he wants to eliminate FEMA entirely and DOGE is conducting a review of FEMA operations. TSA: More than 240 employees were fired in February “due to performance and conduct issues during their probationary period,” TSA spokesperson Robert Langston told Bloomberg—the outlet added it’s not unusual for probationary TSA workers to be terminated due to performance, and the Office of Personnel Management notes it’s “less cumbersome” to fire federal staff during the probationary period soon after they’re hired. Office of Community Planning and Development: The Trump administration is aiming to cut the office, an arm of the department of Housing and Urban Development, from 936 staffers to 150, or 84%, the New York Times reported, citing a document it obtained detailing the plans. Department of Defense: The Pentagon said it began laying off approximately 5,400 probationary workers, or 5% to 8% of its civilian staff, in late February and has implemented a hiring freeze to comply with DOGE’s workforce reduction plan. Health agencies: Some 5,200 probationary employees across the National Institutes of Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are being targeted for layoffs, according to multiple outlets, with Bloomberg reporting that employees at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and the Food and Drug Administration were also laid off. Department of Energy: As many as 2,000 probationary employees at the agency have been fired, according to Politico, citing anonymous sources—though Bloomberg reports some department staff who work on nuclear security were asked back. Department of Education: Some probationary employees at the agency—including those from the general counsel’s office, office of Special Education and Rehabilitation and Federal Student Aid office—were notified of their terminations via a letter that cited their “performance,” an unnamed union source who claimed “dozens” of employees were let go told CNN. U.S. Forest Service: More than 3,400 employees have been fired, two people familiar with the firings told Politico. Small Business Administration: Some probationary employees at the agency received emails notifying them of their terminations, before another email said the initial notices were a mistake, only to be notified in a third email days later confirming their firings, Bloomberg reported. Office of Personnel Management: Probationary employees at the office who did not take the Trump administration’s buyout offer were let go in early February, a union official with the American Federation of Government Employees told NPR. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau: The union that represents workers at the financial agency said about 73 of its members had been terminated, after the agency—which has drawn ire from Trump’s tech allies—was ordered to stop all work, though union leaders and the Trump administration reached a deal in mid-February to prevent more agency employees from being terminated while litigation challenging the dismantling of the agency is pending. National Nuclear Safety Administration: An employee at the agency—which oversees nuclear weapons in the U.S.—told NPR the agency would fire about 300 of the agency’s 1,800 staff, though the Trump administration is now reportedly trying to rehire some of those employees. General Services Administration: More than 100 people were affected by layoffs at the agency responsible for the federal government’s real estate portfolio, three people familiar with the matter told Reuters. Federal Aviation Administration: About 400 FAA were terminated in mid-February—just weeks after the fatal collision over the Potomac River that killed 67 people—with the layoffs including some in safety-specific roles, the Associated Press reported, though the Department of Transportation said roles that “are critical to safety” were spared and the layoffs targeted probationary employees. Get Forbes Breaking News Text Alerts: We’re launching text message alerts so you'll always know the biggest stories shaping the day’s headlines. Text “Alerts” to (201) 335-0739 or sign up here. The Trump administration ordered agency leaders in a Feb. 26 memo to submit plans for reducing their workforces by March 13, indicating the most sweeping layoffs are forthcoming. The significant staff cuts across the federal government have been largely attributed to Musk’s DOGE, as part of its broader mission to root out purported government waste. In a Cabinet meeting March 6, Trump reportedly told agency heads they ultimately have authority over firing, rather than Musk—a move that could help the Trump administration fight lawsuits over DOGE’s authority. Trump suggested following the meeting that Musk would still have some control over the firings, however, telling reporters that if agency heads “can cut, it’s better, and if they don’t cut, then Elon will do the cutting.” It’s not immediately clear how many staff have been affected by widespread layoffs across the Trump administration, which are separate from voluntary buyout deals offered to more than 2 million federal workers. Trump’s administration has reportedly made a number of other high-profile terminations: At least 17 inspectors general, the chief financial officer at the Federal Emergency Management Agency plus three other FEMA workers, U.S. Coast Guard Commandant Linda Fagan, more than a dozen prosecutors who worked on cases against Trump, multiple senior FBI officials, the director of the Office of Government Ethics, and several high-ranking military officials, including Air Force Gen. Charles Q. Brown. Mostly new employees who have been in the federal workforce for less than a year and are not afforded some job protections, including a right to appeal terminations. Probationary employees are the target of the Trump administration’s layoffs, according to multiple reports. More than 200,000 federal workers are probationary employees. The Trump administration separately offered all federal civilian workers pay with benefits through September if they choose to voluntarily resign, an offer 75,000 federal workers reportedly accepted. The administration has suggested employees who don’t participate in the program could be subject to the mass terminations. At least for many probationary employees, probably not, according to U.S. District Judge William Alsup, who ordered the Office of Personnel Management to rescind firing directives at the heart of the probationary government employee layoffs, The Wall Street Journal reported. Meanwhile, the Trump administration is facing multiple lawsuits over some of the more high-profile firings. An appeals court ruled Wednesday Trump had the authority to remove head of the Office of Special Counsel, Hampton Dellinger, temporarily stalling a lower court order that required Trump to reinstate him while the case plays out in court. Dellinger’s office also filed a lawsuit to block Trump from firing probationary employees, arguing the mass terminations are in violation of federal protocol that only allows probationary employees to be fired for “individualized cause.” Several labor unions have also sued the Trump administration over the mass firings, and at least two judges have sided with the Trump administration, ruling the unions didn’t show necessary harm to justify the lawsuits. Eight inspectors general also argued in a lawsuit filed in mid-February their terminations violated federal rules that require the executive branch to give Congress 30 days notice before firing them, plus a justification for the terminations. The administration is also facing lawsuits from former National Labor Relations Board Chair Gwynne Wilcox, who was fired by Trump on Jan. 27, and former Merit Systems Protection Board member Cathy Harris, who was fired Feb. 10. A federal judge ruled Tuesday Harris’ firing was “unlawful,” reinstating her for the remainder of her term expiring in 2028. Federal regulations of mass layoffs, known as “reduction in force,” require the government to give 60 days advance notice of a layoff. The job must also be eliminated entirely—not an attempt to replace a worker, according to the Wall Street Journal. Employees who believe the administration broke protocol in terminating them can file complaints with the Merit Systems Protection Board. There are also protections in place for independent boards and commissions, such as the NLRB. Presidents can only fire members of the board for “malfeasance” or “neglect of duty,” according to the Wall Street Journal. Trump is aiming for budget cuts between 30% and 40%, on average, across all government agencies, with staffing reductions serving as a major area for spending rollbacks, the Washington Post reported, citing two anonymous sources. Many of the spending cuts are led by billionaire Elon Musk and his Department of Government Efficiency. Trump signed an executive order to reinstate a policy from his first term that reclassified tens of thousands of federal civilian employees to at-will employees, making it easier for him to fire them by ridding them of their job protections. Several unions, including the American Federation of Government Employees, the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees and the National Treasury Employees Union have filed lawsuits to block Schedule F from taking effect. Schedule F is unrelated to the mass layoffs of probationary employees, but is widely viewed as another tool Trump can use to exert outsized power over the makeup of the federal workforce. Some Republicans have begun to speak out about the widespread job cuts, with Musk’s controversial email to federal employees asking them to detail five accomplishments sparking a new round of criticism. Multiple Republicans called for Musk to exercise more “compassion” in his effort to reduce the federal workforce in the wake of the email. Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, gave some of the sharpest criticism of her Republican colleagues, calling the email “absurd” and likening the directive to “intimidation,” while others have expressed concerns that Congress doesn’t have enough information about DOGE’s activities. Musk met with Republicans this week and reportedly attempted to downplay his role in the terminations, insisting they were at the discretion of agency leaders, CNN reported. The White House has also said repeatedly Musk is not in charge of DOGE and is instead a “special government employee” who is not paid and acts in an advisory capacity.

TITLE: Gene Hackman Died Of Heart Disease—And Wife Killed By Rare Mouse-Borne Virus, Officials Say
DATE: Mar 7, 2025,
CONTENT:
Actor Gene Hackman’s cause of death was a form of heart disease, with Alzheimer’s as a significant contributor, and his wife died of a rare virus typically carried by rodents, New Mexico officials revealed Friday—offering more details on the unexplained deaths. Actor Gene Hackman and wife Betsy Arakawa pose for a portrait in 1986 in Los Angeles, California. ... [+] (Photo by Donaldson Collection/Michael Ochs Archives/Getty Images) Dr. Heather Jarrell, chief medical examiner in the New Mexico Office of the Medical Investigator, said Hackman, 95, “was in a very poor state of health, he had significant heart disease”—specifically, hypertensive and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease—and she believed that is “ultimately that is what resulted in his death.” Jarrell said Arakawa, 65, died of hantavirus, which is a potentially fatal virus most often transmitted by mice that Jarrell said begins with flu-like symptoms before developing quickly into fluid in one’s lungs that can be fatal (the Mayo Clinic calls Hantavirus pulmonary syndrome rare). Officials said further tests on Hackman’s pacemaker showed it last recorded data on Feb. 18, meaning that is likely when he died, and it is likely his wife died first, with the last known date of her being alive being Feb. 11. Santa Fe County Sheriff Adan Mendoza said it is likely that Hackman was home with his deceased wife for a week and that because of his “advanced” Alzheimer’s, “it’s quite possible that he was not aware that she was deceased.” The couple’s official causes of death were revealed one week after Mendoza said both of them tested negative for carbon monoxide in initial, expedited tests amid suspicion that may have played a role in the mysterious deaths.

Text “Alerts” to (201) 335-0739 or sign up here. Arakawa’s official cause of death was hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, a rare disease caused by hantavirus. Hantavirus infection—normally caused by contact with mice or other rodents—is characterized by “flu-like symptoms” and can progress to “shortness of breath and cardiac or heart failure and lung failure” in a one- to eight-week period after exposure to excrements from rodents that carry the virus, Jarrell said. Hantavirus can be fatal, with the mortality rate of the strain found in the Southwest at 38% to 50%. The strain of hantavirus found in New Mexico is found primarily in deer mice and can be transmitted from animal to human, but not human to human. Very. From 1993 through 2022, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recorded just 864 cases of hantavirus, most of which were found in New Mexico, followed by Colorado and Arizona. Erin Phipps, a New Mexico state public health veterinarian who spoke Friday, said they have identified between one and seven Hantavirus infections in people annually through the end of 2024, and 42% of the state’s cases have been fatal. Hantavirus can be transmitted to people through “rodent urine, droppings or saliva,” Phipps said. Hantavirus is most commonly transmitted at a patient’s residence or workplace, though Phipps said the risk of exposure in the Hackmans’ primary residence was low. They identified signs of rodent entry in some structures on the property, but could not say definitively how Arakawa contracted the virus. Jarrell said Friday Hackman had “very extensive heart disease” and was predisposed to abnormal heart rhythms. She said the official cause of death was hypertensive and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, which can stem from unmanaged high blood pressure and the buildup of fats, cholesterol and other substances in and on the artery walls that can lead to heart problems like heart attacks and failure, according to Cleveland Clinic and Mayo Clinic. Hackman and Arakawa were found deceased in their New Mexico home on Feb. 26 after a concerned neighbor called for deputies to come to the home. Hackman was found on the floor of the house’s mud room and Arakawa was found in the bathroom, with pills scattered nearby. One dog was found dead in a crate in a closet near Arakawa, and two other dogs were found alive on the property. Initially, Mendoza told reporters there was “no immediate sign of foul play,” but local law enforcement said on a search warrant affidavit the deaths were “suspicious enough in nature to require a thorough search and investigation.” Hackman won two Academy Awards during his time as an actor, and was best known for his roles in “The French Connection” and “Unforgiven.” Gene Hackman, Betsy Arakawa Test Negative For Carbon Monoxide, Sheriff Says (Forbes) Actor Gene Hackman And His Wife Found Dead With Pills Scattered Nearby, Police Say (Forbes)  One Community.

TITLE: Hong Kong’s 50 Richest 2025: Stock Market Rally Lifts Wealth But Property Woes Linger

ByJane Ho , Forbes Staff. HONG KONG, CHINA - 2024/04/29: A Star Ferry crosses the Victoria Harbour as Hong Kong Island city skyscrapers and the financial district skyline are seen in the background. (Photo by Sebastian Ng/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) This story is part of Forbes’ coverage of Hong Kong’s Richest 2025. See the full list here. Though Hong Kong’s economy grew at a modest pace of 2.5% in 2024, China’s stimulus measures lifted investor sentiment, driving up the benchmark Hang Seng index by more than a third from a year ago. But with lingering property woes and looming trade tensions, the collective net worth of Hong Kong’s 50 richest tycoons only edged up to $301 billion from $296 billion last year. ss The wealth of 30 list members increased, led by Li Ka-shing, who continues to hold the top spot with his fortune up slightly to $37.3 billion. While the prolonged downturn in the property market knocked down shares of his flagship CK Asset Holding, other better-performing investments in his portfolio, such as videoconferencing giant Zoom Communications, made up for the slack. Real estate magnate Lee Shau Kee held on to his perch as the city’s second-richest with a net worth of $29.2 billion. His Henderson Land Development’s latest Hong Kong landmark is The Henderson, a $3.3 billion, 36-story office tower. Property and jewelry tycoon Henry Cheng remained at No. 3 but his fortune, shared with his family, fell the most in dollar terms by $2.6 billion to $19.5 billion. Shares of his Chow Tai Fook Jewellery Group slumped as demand in China slowed. Another blow was from Cheng’s debt-laden property arm New World Development, which said it had received offers for its various assets, including a Hong Kong mall under its flagship K11 brand. Alibaba cofounder and chairman Joseph Tsai recorded the biggest dollar gain of $2.3 billion this year, thanks partly to rising Alibaba shares following the January release of a new version of its AI model Qwen. A passion for sports also paid off: Tsai sold a 15% stake in BSE Global, which owns NBA team Brooklyn Nets, for $688 million to American billionaire Julia Koch. Buoyant demand for sports apparel drove up shares of clothing manufacturer Crystal International Group, supplier to brands such as Uniqlo and Lululemon. That boosted cofounder Kenneth Lo’s wealth by 64% to $1.8 billion, making him the biggest gainer in percentage terms. A new face this year is that of Francis Lui, the eldest son of casino mogul Lui Che Woo, who died last November. Francis, who shares his fortune with family, was vice chairman of Galaxy Entertainment Group, one of the largest gaming and hospitality companies in Macau, before he was named as its chairman in December. The other newcomer is Yang Qiumei, who inherited a stake in Chinese AI giant SenseTime from her late husband Tang Xiao’ou, cofounder of the company, who died in 2023. The sole returnee this year is Zhuo Jun, who inherited shares in Shenzhen Kinwong Electronic more than a decade ago from her late husband. The printed circuit board maker’s stock nearly doubled in the past 12 months as demand from auto-related and server companies shot up. Two from last year dropped off including Li Sze Lim, cofounder of Guangzhou, China-based R&F Properties, which got weighed down by debt amid China’s property crisis. The cutoff this year rose to $1.4 billion from $1.1 billion. Full Coverage of Hong Kong’s Richest 2025: Editing assistance and reporting by Anuradha Raghunathan.

TITLE: Trump Won’t Deny There Could Be A Recession—Warns Of ‘Period Of Transition’ In Economy
DATE: Mar 9, 2025,
CONTENT:
President Donald Trump did not deny there could be a recession this year under his leadership, telling Fox News there would be a “period of transition” as his economic policies take effect, as the president’s rapidly shifting tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada have rattled the stock market and led to warnings of an economic downturn. President Donald Trump speaks before signing executive orders in the Oval Office of the White House ... [+] on March 6 in Washington, DC. “Sunday Morning Futures” host Maria Bartiromo asked Trump whether he expected there would be a recession this year, to which Trump responded, “I hate to predict things like that.” “There is a period of transition, because what we’re doing is very big,” Trump said about implementing his economic agenda like tariffs, adding, “It takes a little time, but I think [his agenda] should be great for us.” The president also downplayed the stock market dropping over the past week in response to his tariffs, telling Bartiromo the market hadn’t gone down by “much” and saying he “can’t really watch the stock market” as he implements his economic policies, adding, “You can’t go by that, you have to do what’s right.” Economists upped the odds of a recession this week and cited Trump’s economic policies as the “key risk” that could cause one, amid troubling indicators like lower consumer sentiment, mounting layoffs and the stock market’s decline, with the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta projecting March 6 that the U.S.’ economic output will contract by an annualized rate of -2.4% in 2025’s first quarter. The stock market also suffered its worst week in six months amid uncertainty over Trump’s tariffs, with Nvidia and Tesla having the biggest declines. Trump is expected to implement more tariffs this week, as Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told “Meet the Press” on Sunday that tariffs on imports of steel and aluminum will take effect Wednesday. Trump is also planning to implement reciprocal tariffs on foreign goods—meaning the U.S. will tax a nation’s imports at the same rate they tax U.S. exports—starting April 2. The president suggested the frequent flip-flops in his tariff policies could continue, telling Bartiromo the tariff rates he’s announced “won’t go down, but we may go up.” When Bartiromo asked whether companies can expect more predictability from Trump’s economic agenda, the president demurred, saying, “Well I think so, but you know, the tariffs could go up as time goes by.” Lutnick downplayed fears of a recession much more than Trump on “Meet the Press” on Sunday, saying right before Trump’s Fox interview aired, “There’s going to be no recession in America.” “Donald Trump is bringing growth to America. I would never bet on a recession. No chance,” Lutnick said, after responding, “Absolutely not,” when asked if Americans should brace for a recession. The National Bureau of Economic Research broadly defines a recession as a “significant decline in economic activity that is spread across the economy and lasts more than a few months,” though more specific definitions of the term say a recession happens when there’s negative growth in the nation’s gross domestic product for at least two consecutive quarters. Trump on Tuesday imposed 25% tariffs on imported goods from Canada and Mexico, as well as higher tariffs on China, only to later pull back on those fees. He paused tariffs on auto imports from Canada and Mexico for one month and temporarily exempted all goods that are covered under the U.S.’ free trade agreement with Mexico and Canada until April 2. In addition to planned reciprocal tariffs and taxing imports of steel and aluminum, Trump has also suggested he could still impose higher tariffs on Canadian lumber and dairy. Trump’s tariffs are a centerpiece of his economic agenda, but have been sharply criticized by economists, who have long warned his tariffs will raise prices for American consumers and could ultimately harm the nation’s economy. Some companies including Best Buy and Target suggested they were planning to raise prices as a result of Trump’s tariffs taking effect, sparking further criticism of the tariffs’ impacts on Americans. Trump repeatedly claimed before the election that his tariffs would only harm foreign countries and not raise prices, but he and his administration’s top officials have more recently acknowledged the policy could lead to higher prices—while insisting the temporary increase is necessary to achieve longer-term economic goals. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told CNBC on Friday the economy could need to have a “detox period,” after saying Thursday the American dream was not primarily about “access to cheap goods,” while Lutnick acknowledged to “Meet the Press” that foreign goods may get “more expensive” as the tariffs are implemented. Trump said in his speech to Congress on Tuesday that his tariffs will cause “a little disturbance, but we are OK with that.”      One Community.

TITLE: CDC Plans Large Study On Long-Debunked Connection Between Vaccines And Autism, Report Says
DATE: Mar 7, 2025,
CONTENT:
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention—which falls under the purview of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.—is planning to study potential connections between vaccines and autism, Reuters reported Friday, a link Kennedy has controversially pushed in the past. A view of the sign of Center for Disease Control headquarters is seen in Atlanta, Georgia, United ... [+] States on August 06, 2022. (Photo by Nathan Posner/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images) Two unnamed sources familiar with the matter told Reuters of the planned study, though it was unclear whether Kennedy, a known-vaccine skeptic who has pushed the conspiracy that autism is linked to vaccination, is involved. The CDC’s page on frequently asked questions about autism—which was last updated on Nov. 5, 2024—states that, “to date, the studies continue to show that vaccines are not associated with” autism spectrum disorder. There have been a number of scientific studies done in the past that have shown no connection between vaccination and autism, but 20 years ago, Kennedy emerged as the most prominent figure pushing the conspiracy. Forbes has reached out to the CDC for comment. Get Forbes Breaking News Text Alerts: We’re launching text message alerts so you'll always know the biggest stories shaping the day’s headlines. Text “Alerts” to (201) 335-0739 or sign up here. Kennedy’s stance that vaccines may cause autism, along with his other stances on the safety of various vaccinations, has been slammed by health experts and organizations who argue he is spreading long-discredited theories. Kennedy was among the most well-known public figures spreading the theory for years: In 2005, he published a later-retracted article claiming a preservative used to prevent vaccine vial contamination was tied to childhood neurological disorders—a theory that CDC experts have long rejected. He also cites a decades-old CDC study when alleging vaccines are tied to autism, despite one of the authors of the study saying it gave no conclusion on a potential connection, according to FactCheck.org. Kennedy has also falsely stated as recently as last year that there are no adults “with full-blown autism,” repeating that belief when he appeared on Joe Rogan’s podcast last summer. His claims were questioned heavily by lawmakers during his confirmation hearings. During the hearings, Kennedy said he was not “anti-vaccine” but is “pro-safety,” though he refused to say there is no link between autism and vaccines. In October, before he was appointed to lead HHS, Kennedy said in a post on X he is “not going to take anyone's vaccines away from them. I just want to be sure every American knows the safety profile, the risk profile, and the efficacy of each vaccine.” Since being elected, Trump has discussed the rise in autism rates—which many experts believe is linked to more frequent diagnoses—and said in a post on Truth Social “something’s really wrong. We need BOBBY!!!” referring to Kennedy. In his joint address to Congress on Tuesday, Trump cited the rise in autism in children and said, “we’re going to find out what it is, and there’s nobody better than Bobby and all of the people that are working with you.” In 2014, Trump weighed in more specifically on the conspiracy that vaccines cause autism, saying in a post on X: “Healthy young child goes to doctor, gets pumped with massive shot of many vaccines, doesn't feel good and changes - AUTISM. Many such cases!” Yes, autism diagnoses have been on the rise. The CDC reported in 2020 that 1 in 36 children were diagnosed with autism, an increase from from 1 in 150 two decades earlier. Researchers maintain there are no trusted scientific studies that show a connection between vaccines and autism, and the CDC says there have been nine agency-funded or conducted studies that have shown no link between thimerosal-containing vaccines and autism. Rather, researchers say the increase can be attributed to things including more awareness, more parents having children at a later age and increased risk factors like exposure to toxic chemicals and viral infections during pregnancy, The New York Times reported. A since-retracted 1998 medical study from Andrew Wakefield hypothesized there could be a connection between the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine and the development of autism. The paper was discredited by health experts, retracted and Wakefield lost his medical license for acting “dishonestly and irresponsibly” while conducting research, ABC News reported. On Wednesday, Trump’s pick to lead the National Institutes of Health indicated he was open to funding new studies looking into potential links between vaccines and autism. Dr. Jay Bhattacharya said in his confirmation hearing that he’s “convinced” there is not a link between the MMR vaccine and autism, but would “support a broad scientific agenda based on data to get an answer” to why the rate of children being diagnosed with autism is increasing.

TITLE: The Evolution of Luxury Brand Porsche
DATE: March 04, 2025
CONTENT:
Porsche has reigned as one of the world’s leading sports and luxury car companies for nearly 80 years. Central to the German automaker’s growth strategy is creating stellar customer experiences and great products, such as the legendary 911 Carrera sports car. But the automotive industry is undergoing disruptive changes and bringing new competitive challenges from around the world. Company leadership is adapting Porsche’s product portfolio, recently adding the electric model Taycan. They’re also innovating new customer experiences like the “Track Your Dream” program. In this episode, Harvard Business School Professor Stefan Thomke explores how the storied company will continue to change in a bid to stay relevant—yet also remain true to its legacy—in the case “Porsche.” BRIAN KENNY: Listeners to Cold Call know that every episode is based on a business case written by a Harvard Business School faculty member. There are about 15,000 cases actively available through Harvard Business Publishing and another 45,000 or so retired cases in the collection. But here’s a fun fact. Of those 60,000 or so cases, there is just one that has a single word as its title, “Porsche.” A brand synonymous with speed, performance, and exhilaration. A brand that according to Interbrand stands head and shoulders above the competition as the most valuable luxury and premium brand in the world for the seventh consecutive year. A brand born of humble origins, namely the Volkswagen Beetle, that has become an icon of high-performance sports cars the world over. Today on Cold Call, we welcome Professor Stefan Thomke to discuss the case, “Porsche.” I’m your host, Brian Kenny, and you’re listening to Cold Call on the HBR podcast network. Stefan Thomke’s research focuses on the process, economics and management of business experimentation and innovation. He is a second-time guest, I think, on Cold Call. Stefan, welcome back. STEFAN THOMKE: Thank you. Thanks for having me. BRIAN KENNY: The last time you were here, we were talking about booking.com. That was a fun conversation. STEFAN THOMKE: Excellent. BRIAN KENNY: Yeah, this is completely different than that one. STEFAN THOMKE: Very different. BRIAN KENNY: I think. I’m going to ask you at the outset, are you a Porsche enthusiast? STEFAN THOMKE: For sure. Yes. Full confession. Full confession. BRIAN KENNY: And what does that mean? Tell our listeners, in what way are you a Porsche enthusiast? STEFAN THOMKE: Well, in a number of ways. Of course, love the products, love the products. There’s something really unique about them, but there’s also a personal connection here. I grew up near sort of the Porsche factory or headquarters, just about 35 miles away from them. And so when you grow up in that area, you see these cars all the time. So you see the evolution of these products over the years, and you do have neighbors who work for the company too, and to talk about that and sometimes take one of these products home. And I remember when we were kids, we were just staring at these cars and seemed like out of this world, and it was a dream. It was a dream just to not own one, but just sit in one of these cars. And so that’s a really personal connection. And then there’s another story which I remember very vividly, and in 1993, I had sort of this rare opportunity to be a passenger in one of those cars. And in fact, it was the cup car of the winner of Le Mans on the test track in Weissach, which is not far from my home. And that was the first time in my life that I realized what these cars are capable of. Basically you have a driver who does not brake. As you go through course, your hand was shaking when you got out of the car and you’re sort of thinking, wow. Most of these cars are driven maybe at 10 or 20% of what they’re capable of. BRIAN KENNY: Well, I love this, the one name title in the case, just “Porsche,” it’s like Sting or Prince. Everybody knows what it is. You don’t have to explain it. So it’ll be a lot of fun to talk about it here. And the case was really interesting. I’m going to ask you to start just by telling us what the central issue is in the case and what your cold call is when you start the discussion. STEFAN THOMKE: Well, the central issue of the case is how do you actually grow this company? So the company has gone public and you’re the CEO of this company, and you look at the world around you, there’s a lot going on in the automotive industry ranging from disruptions, electrification, global trade wars, China and so forth. And so I start out in this case with this cold call and saying, imagine you’re the CEO, what’s happening around you? How do you assess the situation? And we do a SWOT analysis. The central theme of the company is trying to understand their strategy, their growth strategy, as they’re sort of going forward, as they’re trying to improve their profitability, they’re already very profitable and understand sort of what they call a luxury strategy. Now it seems a little odd, right, because we think of them as a luxury product. But they don’t really think of themselves that way. They think of themselves as a sports car company. And so the product is definitely what we would probably call a luxury product, but perhaps the whole experience, the customer experience is not. And so they’re trying to retool the company to create a luxury company or luxury strategy, which we try to define and it seems often a bit of a nebulous thing. And then we go into the operational details of what does it actually mean? How do you actually improve the customer experience, what’s not working in the customer experience? We create customer journeys and we have a look at one of their initiatives called, “Track Your Dream,” where they’re trying to fill some of the gaps that they’re actually finding in the marketplace in terms of customer interactions on the customer journey. And then we sort of look at how do we actually monetize that? And so it’s a lot of issues in 90 minutes to cover, but generally a lot of enthusiasm. BRIAN KENNY: And we’re going to dive a little bit deeper into some of the things that you just mentioned. I always am curious about what motivates faculty to write a case about something. Why do they think it’s going to be a good case and why do they think it’s going to work. Here, I think we understand some of your motivation as you described it, but at the same time, it seems like the brands that have the most amazing staying power, some of these legacy brands also are the brands that continue to innovate all the time. They never sort of rest on their laurels, and it sounds like that’s Porsche. STEFAN THOMKE: But what motivates me here, clearly the brand itself, it’s a fascinating story. There’s clearly an emotional connection to it as well, an admiration for the products and trying to understand where that name recognition comes from. How do you create such a brand over time? And in their case, it’s what I call incremental innovation because if you look at their core product, the 911 Carrera, has been a product of evolution because you look at it and they always refine it. They always make it better. There’s a saying always that the latest one is always the best one. And of course there’s a lot of innovation that also happens under the skin when you look at sort of telematics and all sorts of things that are happening to this company. But okay, so it’s fascinating trying to understand what has been driving this company, what has made it so great, and what has it made so iconic in the eyes of their customers. BRIAN KENNY: And you mentioned to me also that you had a chance to go to the factory, so you sort of had a deep look at this and you said it was a pretty intense case-writing experience. Can you talk a little more about that? STEFAN THOMKE: Oh yeah. I mean, to write a really good field case can take a long time, and for us, the whole process was at least a year from the time that we approached the company until we finally had the case signed off, done. And it involved a lot of different things, lots of background research, of course. Then we did interviews there. My co-author, Daniela Beyersdorfer, from the Research Center in Paris. And we did many, many interviews with all the executive team members, we also interviewed engineers, product leaders. It was a long, long list of people. We went to the factories. We went to the development center in Weissach as well. And it was kind of for me, amazing to see these places because the last time I saw them was 30 years ago, just see how they’ve changed. And then at the end when we came out of this, we had several hundred pages of notes and that we had to distill to a 15, 16 page case study with exhibits. BRIAN KENNY: That’s a great glimpse into the kind of work that goes into case research generally speaking. Maybe you can help us just sort of situate Porsche in the landscape in which it competes. Where do they sit amongst the Lamborghinis and the Ferraris, but also the Teslas and the other cars that they’re competing with? STEFAN THOMKE: Yeah, I mean, I would say they’re a volume premium producer as opposed to a Ferrari or so. They make a little bit more than 300,000 cars a year. So clearly a lot of volume behind it. Whereas Ferrari makes maybe a little over 10,000 or so. So the volume actually matters. Their premium, they cover quite a bit of range. They’re super high-end. Some of the most expensive models can easily cost you $300,000 or more. But they also have in quotes, entry-level models, which tend to be maybe closer to a hundred thousand, but you can get into the cars less than a hundred thousand, say a Macan or so. And so they try to cover a very, very broad range, but within each sort of segment, they try to be sort of a premium performer, premium car, but also a performance car. So it’s not just an SUV, but it’s a Porsche SUV that has certain performance requirements. BRIAN KENNY: So we talked about the 911 a little bit. That’s been their bread and butter for decades at this point, but they have pushed in to other areas. What is the sort of strategy that they’re thinking about behind these efforts to innovate in the marketplace? STEFAN THOMKE: Well, first of all, cover these segments with innovative products and get a good margin out of that. That’s been pretty much their strategy. Stay true to the tradition. The 911, again, has been around for over 60 years, but that’s their core car that it saved the company a number of times. If you look back in the early 1990s, the company was in trouble and it was the 911 and then another car called the Boxster, which is now called the 718, that actually saved them. But the 911 has been a constantly successful car. It’s always a best-selling car. There’s always more demand for it than they probably could supply. And so a lot of that is sort of at the core. But then of course they have SUVs, they have a Cayenne, they have an entry-level Macan, they have again, a roadster, which is the Boxster 718. So they try to cover a lot of segments. So their strategy has been essentially to cover many different segments. And then of course there’s the EV segment, which has been a new one for them and has also been probably one of the more challenging for them. BRIAN KENNY: Yeah. And we hear that a lot, and we’ve covered other cases about automobile manufacturers that are moving into EVs and the tremendous strain that it puts on their resources. They have to think differently about every aspect of the vehicle. They need a new supply chain, they need new suppliers. How’s Porsche thinking about all that? STEFAN THOMKE: It’s kind of interesting because we often criticize companies for being too slow when these innovations come. They were actually quite fast. In fact, they announced the first concept car, the EV concept car, in 2015, so 10 years ago, and were pretty quick to execute. But yes, they faced all these challenges, a completely new supply chain. What even made it sort of more difficult for them is that they set the requirements to be much higher than all the other EVs out there because it had to be done the Porsche way, and that meant specifically to go to an 800-volt structure. Pretty much every EV uses 400 volts. They learned from their racing car division motorsports, that 800 volts is actually a way better system, but they really had no suppliers who could actually supply parts that could work in an 800-volt environment. So they had to go out and had to ask the suppliers to retool for 800 volts. When you have 800 volts, you can actually save weight because you can make the cables to be smaller and all that because at a higher voltage, you can just move more energy around the car. BRIAN KENNY: And you said you’ve driven one of these? STEFAN THOMKE: Yeah, not have just driven one, I also bought one too. I was really curious about EVs. I think we all need to have an open mind here, and so I was thinking about that first. My left brain kind of did an analysis of EVs. I looked at it and I said, well, it makes a lot of sense. It’s way more efficient than an internal combustion engine. Efficiency difference is something like 50% or so. It’s kind of amazing. And so it makes a lot of sense. It requires less maintenance, but the question I had, am I going to like it? Do I like the driving experience? Is it going to be convenient? Can I charge it? All these questions go through my head. Sometimes the only way to find out is just to do it. And so that’s the reason why I did it, and I’ve been really, really impressed. I like it much more than I thought I would. Even though I was a diehard sort of internal combustion engine fan, I still drive cars with internal combustion engines, but the Taycan experience has been phenomenal. I enjoy it much more than I thought I would. BRIAN KENNY: Yeah. You talked about beginning the class, talking about what the CEO of Porsche sees when he looks out there at the marketplace. I’m wondering what they see now when they look at the future of EVs, and I ask that in the context of the United States seems to be sort of stepping back from that. There was a lot of excitement. There were government mandates, those have been pulled away. The rest of the world might be quite different. What do you think he sees when he looks? STEFAN THOMKE: Yes, so unfortunately they’re stepping back because I think the future will be EVs, the long-term future, but for a company, it’s all about timing. And so when they first launched the Taycan, it was a very successful product. There was a lot of demand, but now some of the markets pulled back. Some of the other markets have stepped on the accelerator. So China, for example, had made a huge commitment to EVs, and so now they’re facing competition there because they have EVs at a much lower price. So that’s a different kind of competition. I think the picture is mixed in Europe. Some markets are pulling back, some of the markets are going ahead with it, but it creates an issue for a company like Porsche because they made a commitment, a public commitment to have 80% of their sales by 2030, just EVs. And if you follow the press releases lately, they had to make a change in strategy now because the market conditions just demanded it. And so they’re pulling back and they now have to reinvest in developing internal combustion engine platforms and things like that because I think they were just moving faster than the market. BRIAN KENNY: And they’re not alone. We’ve heard that from other car makers as well. STEFAN THOMKE: Yeah. BRIAN KENNY: Let’s talk a little bit about the move towards luxury as they think about luxury, what does that mean in the context of a Porsche? How are they thinking about it? STEFAN THOMKE: Well, that’s what we’re trying to figure out as part of the discussion. What does it mean? Because it’s a little bit counterintuitive to the participants when they first get into this because they first think of it as a luxury product. But again, luxury means more than just a product. They may have an amazing product, but there is a lot more to owning a car. It’s the whole experience is first of all, how you get to know the product? So the experience before you even own the product, before you can order the product. Then when you order the product, what happens until you actually get it? It’s not like in most cases that you walk up to the dealer lot and just pick one up. You want to have it customized. You want to have a car, you’re not going to buy many of these cars. So you want to have the car sort of done in a way just for you. And so you customize it. Now you’re going to have to wait. It may take six months or maybe a year or so until you actually get your car. And then once you have the car, you have a post-purchase experience. So luxury means that all these experiences have to be amazing. And so we have it in the case, so if someone comes in and orders a car and then they don’t hear anything for six or 12 months and get no information, what’s actually happening to their dream, that’s not a luxury experience. And so part of the case is trying to kind of figure out how to solve these problems. How do you actually turn this into an overall luxury experience, not just the product? BRIAN KENNY: Right. And this is part of the “Track Your Dream” program that they have. Can you describe that a little bit for our listeners? STEFAN THOMKE: So the moment you walk in and you actually order a car, you get a number and you can go on an app and you can actually track the process of how your car gets to you. You get production pictures, so they show you what the car looks like in production. Once your car is done, you get a date when it’s done, you also get an expected date in the app as well. Once your car gets shipped, you get logistics information. And what they do essentially is they have an internal system, which they’ve created a really amazing system that has something like 150 milestones, internal milestones of the company that they track and collect data on. They decide to make 11 of those milestones available to the buyer. And so you can now see it live. You can see how many days actually your car sits at the port. BRIAN KENNY: I don’t know if that’s a good thing or not. STEFAN THOMKE: Well, that’s the issue, right? And you could see when it’s supposed to arrive at the dealer and you see how many days it’s behind and you see when it gets stuck at a port and if the ship that the car is on actually goes down, you can see that as well, which by the way has happened. BRIAN KENNY: And that happened, right? STEFAN THOMKE: Yes, it happened. BRIAN KENNY: That’s described in the case, yeah. STEFAN THOMKE: And I think the idea is that they want to be more transparent with their customers and actually show sort of what’s going on in this whole process rather than keeping them in the dark basically from the time that they answer, order the car, until they get it. BRIAN KENNY: Yeah, it’s a double-edged sword, though, right? Because the more transparent you are, the more you’re maybe showing your faults and your warts to the customer. STEFAN THOMKE: Absolutely, and that’s the gist of the discussion. How much information do you want to show, and is this the right kind of information that you want to show? Do customers really want to know and do they have to know how many days the car is stuck at a port? And so we have a pretty interesting discussion in the classroom on that, and some people will say, the more, the better. We need to be completely transparent with customers and then let the customer figure out how much they want to know. And then versus others will say, no, no, no, no, no. What we do is we don’t want to share all this information with customers. That’s company internal. Customers don’t know how to use that information. Making a car is probably one of the most complex products you’ll ever make in the world, and there are delays as we’ve seen, because supply chain delays, COVID happened, the war in Ukraine. I mean, there are lots of different reasons why they can’t get parts. Then there may be a supplier has a fire. So there are a lot of things going on and how do you make it reliable? And so you may create some anxiety. So the question is, what is then a luxury experience given that you have this tool available? BRIAN KENNY: And the other thing about luxury, so the case talks about the custom models of the 911 that they’re making, which are super exclusive, super high end, which in some ways seems to conflict a little bit with what they’re trying to do is to make the car more accessible, a luxury experience, more accessible to a broader market. How do they sort of balance the exclusivity piece with the accessibility piece? STEFAN THOMKE: Yeah, it’s very difficult because they’re all sold through the same dealers, so you want to have the most high end, most exclusive cars sold through the same dealer and the entry level car as well, and you want to make sure that the experience is pretty amazing for someone who’s spending a lot of money on these cars. They don’t control the dealers, especially in the US by law, there are franchise laws here. They can’t really tell the dealers, for example, what price to charge. And so it gets really tricky and that’s also part of the reason why something like “Track Your Dream” is interesting. What they want to do is they want to build direct relationships with customers, and so how do you actually do that in an environment where most of your relationships are actually indirect, which is really true for a lot of auto companies, especially in the US where the relationship is actually in most cases not very direct. BRIAN KENNY: How do the dealers feel about “Track Your Dream?” Are they fans of it or… STEFAN THOMKE: I don’t know. I’ve been hearing mixed things. On one hand. One hand, the dealers will say, “Oh, it’s great, so at least the customers don’t call me all the time. They can look it up on the app.” BRIAN KENNY: Of course, yeah. STEFAN THOMKE: On the other hand, it’s also maybe a loss of control a little bit because you used to go to the dealer and the dealer would actually tell you where your car is, and now you go directly to the company and the company, you get the information. I don’t know quite honestly whether all dealers are super excited about it, but I’ve heard and I’ve talked to some people and they said it helps me a little bit with keeping the customers informed. Now, some dealers are amazing at informing customers anyway, so the additional value is actually not there because salespeople called, but then some dealers are not. They really do keep customers in the dark. So again, it’s about control. And the bigger thing is how do you build relationships with customers that you eventually you can monetize? BRIAN KENNY: Right, right. It reminds me of the disintermediation. I think that was the word we used to use a lot in the beginning of the early e-commerce days, and it was- STEFAN THOMKE: Not allowed to do this here. Franchise laws in the US. BRIAN KENNY: Yes. Yeah, I guess, smart on the dealer’s part for that. STEFAN THOMKE: Yeah, yeah, yeah. BRIAN KENNY: Can we talk about the suppliers a little bit? STEFAN THOMKE: Sure. BRIAN KENNY: The case points out that I think 80% or something like that, of the parts that Porsche uses are coming from suppliers. I would imagine it’s pretty challenging to try and maintain the quality that you want to maintain to create the best experience with your suppliers. How do they manage that supply chain? STEFAN THOMKE: Also very difficult, very challenging because a lot of the innovation comes through suppliers, supply innovation. When 80% of your parts are from suppliers, supply innovation plays a huge role, and the supplier base has been affected by all these changes. So first they had COVID, and then of course they also had the transition to EV. So many suppliers actually started to invest in EV capabilities and so haven’t reaped sort of the rewards of that. So the supplier base is also having more financial difficulties because of them trying to manage the same transition that the OEMs are trying to manage. And so it’s described in the case as well that they have to learn to work with suppliers, maybe that they have problems. Sometimes you have to send an OEM team actually to help the suppliers, to support the suppliers. You have to sometimes learn how to work with suppliers maybe that are not A+, because they’re going through their own transitions, and that’s all part of the game, especially when you’re trying to create something new like an EV sort of supplier infrastructure. BRIAN KENNY: And just access to raw materials that you need to build the parts that go into the car. STEFAN THOMKE: And volume. BRIAN KENNY: And volume. STEFAN THOMKE: Yeah, volume. If you don’t have the EV volume yet, then it’s kind of harder for the suppliers to invest, and so they have to manage that. So you have to imagine in all this context here, so the suppliers are having difficulties, so there are a lot of challenges if you’re sort of the CEO then. Demand in China has gone down, then China is competing with you as well. They’re creating their own EV industry, and they’re quite successful at it because the numbers there are pretty good, so they’re pushing really hard to go through this transition fast. Then of course, now we have the issue of tariffs. There are so many issues that are going on right now, and you’re the CEO of this company and you’re trying to manage all this. And then there’s also the connection to Volkswagen as well, which is having its own difficulties. BRIAN KENNY: Yeah. Describe that relationship. I know that I mentioned in the introduction that actually the first Porsche was built on the Beetle platform. How strong is the relationship now? STEFAN THOMKE: It’s strong. They’re connected. The CEO of Porsche is also the CEO of Volkswagen. BRIAN KENNY: Wow, there you go. It’s about as strong as it gets. STEFAN THOMKE: Yeah, yeah, so he has both companies in mind when he makes decisions, and so of course they’re trying to use the synergies between these companies, but sometimes maybe if you go too fast on the synergies, maybe you’re also slowing yourself down. Sometimes it’s better maybe just to do things in separate ways so you don’t get too attached, and so they’re trying to kind of balance that as well at the same time. So it’s an interesting time. At the same time, they have this hugely loyal fan base. I mean, they’re diehard Porsche fans. They have races. The products are iconic, and so I think, again, recommitting to these iconic products is probably going to be sort of the way they’re going to go and probably scale back some of the things that they’ve done. BRIAN KENNY: Yeah, we talk about heritage brands on the show quite a bit, and that challenge is always how do you hold onto what is special about the heritage that makes that emotional connection with your customers, while at the same time innovating and always improving, and it’s a really difficult tension to manage, right? STEFAN THOMKE: Imagine, Brian, you’re the person who is in charge of the 911 and the marching order is to go and change it, but don’t change it. BRIAN KENNY: Yeah, yeah. Exactly, exactly. STEFAN THOMKE: And so that’s really the challenge. BRIAN KENNY: So if you’re the CEO and you’re sort of looking out over the next decade, what do you think are the opportunities out there? We’ve talked a lot about the challenges and the risks, but what are the opportunities that they should be looking at? STEFAN THOMKE: I mean, what makes Porsche, right? There are three things that really make the company. It’s the brand, it’s the products, and the people. And so that’s also the opportunity at the same time to go out. I think they will stick of course long-term with EVs. And the EVs, I already told you, I think the EV products, I think the Taycan just is an amazing product. I’ve driven it. It’s direct steering. It really feels like a sports car even though it’s a very heavy car. And just to continue to stay true and making iconic products that really drive like sports cars, no matter which segment they go into. The opportunity is again, making sure that they get some of the very best people, which they have traditionally. They’re rated as among the very top employers in Germany. Every engineer who graduates from a university wants to work for them. And the brand, you keep on investing in the brand, building the brand, and then going to these different segments. The US is a big market. We’ll have to see how that plays out now with what’s going on in the background with tariffs and all that. But they’ll master that. It’s probably going to focus, that’s going to affect probably more some of the lower end cars, maybe not the high-end cars where there’s a lot of demand for. And I’ll give you an example. They had a limited car, the 911 S/T that just came out. They limited it to 1,963 units because the 911 was born in 1963. BRIAN KENNY: What was the price point on that? STEFAN THOMKE: Oh, once you customize it, you easily hit $300,000. You go over $300,000 when you add tax and so forth. So this is not an inexpensive car, but it’s an iconic car and it’s every journalist who drives the car is just blown away by it. So, you have to keep on making cars like that. The question is, should you limit it maybe to 1,963 cars? Maybe it should have done four or five thousand or so, because I imagine the margins are very high on these cars. So, keep on making these cars, but then also sort of take advantage of some of the technology changes that are happening around us. And there are a lot of people there, I think, who love technology. So they’re not averse to any of these things, whether it’s EV or any other technologies, and I think they’ll continually lean into it and stay the course which they traditionally have done. BRIAN KENNY: Stefan, this has been a great conversation as I knew it would be. So one last question for you. I always like to end by asking you, if you want our listeners to remember one thing about the “Porsche” case, what would it be? STEFAN THOMKE: The one thing to remember is products. I always tell in my class of participants as well, if you make an awesome product, you can get away with a lot of things. You probably get away with maybe average marketing, average finance, average, a lot of things. But if your product is no good, it’s going to be really, really hard to keep your customers. So, stay committed to your products. So for all of your listeners, when you think about how you spend your time and if you look at your calendars of the week, how much time do you spend on making sure that your products or your experiences for your customers are really amazing? That I think is something that I would focus on, and that’s what the company has traditionally focused on. BRIAN KENNY: That’s great. Stefan, thanks for joining me.

Hardy III, Carter Gibson and Andrew Barsa For a moment, let’s flash back to 2020: a year when disruptions triggered by the Covid-19 pandemic forced many firms to freeze hiring or lay off workers, creating a labor market in which those looking for work far outstripped open positions. One year later, as the pandemic eased and the economy reopened, firms found themselves in the opposite situation, struggling to fill an excess of open roles. This economic shift helped catapult the Great Resignation, a period lasting from 2021 to 2023 when well over 100 million U.S. workers, finding the market in their favor, quit their jobs, often in pursuit of higher salaries or better benefits.

Her success is about much more than her music—and innovators can learn from it. by Kevin Evers Less than two decades since making her debut recording, Taylor Swift has conquered the music industry. She has released 11 original studio albums, and the combined sales and streams of her music catalog place her among the top 10 best-selling artists of all time—a group dominated by commercial juggernauts such as Michael Jackson, Elvis, Madonna, and Frank Sinatra. Her recently concluded Eras Tour—the highest-grossing tour of all time—set off a global frenzy that sparked comparisons to the Beatles. With a net worth estimated at $1.6 billion, Swift is the most financially successful musician of her generation. And she’s managed to achieve all this during a time when the industry has undergone profound technological and business model shifts, moving from CDs to iTunes to Spotify.
