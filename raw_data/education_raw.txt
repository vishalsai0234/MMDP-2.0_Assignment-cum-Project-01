TITLE: 4 Classroom Design Tactics to Motivate Students
DATE: January 10, 2025

Teachers can make small shifts in their classroom design to boost engagement, spark curiosity, and celebrate success. Your content has been saved! Motivating students can sometimes feel like a battle. We encourage, cajole, and incentivize, hoping they’ll find that inner spark to drive their success. But what if we’re thinking about motivation the wrong way? What if the secret isn’t inside students, but all around them? As behavioral economist Richard H. Thaler and legal scholar Cass R. Sunstein reveal in Nudge: Improving Decisions About Health, Wealth, and Happiness, the environments we create often shape behavior more than we realize. In education, this means that small, deliberate adjustments to the classroom can have outsized effects on students’ motivation and engagement. These changes are easy to implement and can yield noticeable results without draining your energy or theirs. Consider this: Why do people take the stairs when the elevator is broken? It’s not because they suddenly decide to prioritize fitness—it’s because the environment nudges them in that direction. In the classroom, we can use the same approach by designing spaces that nudge students into desired behaviors. One of the simplest ways to boost student motivation is by removing small barriers that hinder engagement. Behavioral science shows that even tiny obstacles can have a significant impact. For example, in an experiment where both bananas and oranges were placed in a bowl, people overwhelmingly chose bananas—not for their taste, but because they were easier to peel. Likewise, eliminating these “peeling problems” in education can lead to substantial improvements in student motivation. The first factor in improving design is thinking of the obstacles that are stopping engagement from being easy. Even minor inconveniences—like missing supplies—can derail focus in the classroom. By reducing barriers, we make it easier for students to start and stick with their work. In my English classroom, I’ve created a Grab-and-Go Station stocked with everything students might need: pencils, pens, highlighters, sticky notes, and even paper. If a student forgets something, they don’t need to ask or waste time searching; they simply head to the station and grab what they need. This simple adjustment has saved countless lessons from interruptions and has made students more self-sufficient. I also encourage students to restock the station as part of our classroom community responsibilities, reinforcing ownership and respect for shared resources. Our brains are wired to respond to visual triggers. A cleverly placed visual cue can prompt action more effectively than a dozen verbal reminders. Research on visual processing shows that these cues bypass mental clutter, making desired behaviors automatic. One strategy I use is a “Question Parking Lot” in my classroom—a whiteboard where students can post questions or advice during independent practice. While working, students must jot down at least one question they’re stuck on or a tip that’s helped them understand the material. For instance, during a lesson on analyzing themes, a student might write, “What does ‘universal theme’ mean?” or “Breaking the passage into smaller parts helped me find the theme.” At the end of the lesson, we revisit the parking lot as a group. This not only gives me insight into where students are struggling but also encourages them to engage more deeply with the material. Additionally, visual cues can help turn reflection into a habit and foster a supportive learning community. In my classroom, I’ve established clearly labeled zones with specific expectations to help students transition smoothly. Labels such as “Quiet Zone,” “Collaboration Area,” and “Turn-In Bin” serve as constant, nonverbal reminders of what’s expected in each space. This simple system minimizes the need for repeated instructions and allows students to move effortlessly between activities. Curiosity is a powerful motivator. Research shows that when students are intrigued, they’re more likely to dive into their work willingly—and even enjoy the process. Before lessons, I post an intriguing question or fun fact on the board. For example, before starting a unit on figurative language, I wrote, “Which phrase was once banned in 19th-century France—‘raining cats and dogs’ or ‘a piece of cake’?” Students couldn’t wait to find out the answer, and that curiosity carried over into the lesson. Posting a visual cue or hook motivates students and helps sustain engagement during the lesson. We often focus so much on the end goal that we forget to celebrate the small wins along the way. Creating a visual space to recognize progress is critical for maintaining momentum, especially with long-term projects or challenging material. In my classroom, we track progress on a “Living Wall”—a shared space where students post sticky notes highlighting their achievements. For example, when we’re analyzing texts, students might post their best theme analysis from the week. This visual record of progress boosts confidence and reminds students that learning is a journey made up of small, meaningful steps. Motivation doesn’t have to be a battle of wills. By reducing friction, using visual cues, sparking curiosity, and celebrating progress, you can create a classroom environment where engagement and success feel natural. You’ll be amazed at how these seemingly minor changes can lead to big results—not just in your students’ motivation, but also in their confidence and enthusiasm for learning. And remember: Sometimes, the best way to inspire isn’t to push harder—it’s to design smarter.

TITLE: 3 Ways to Bring Makerspace Principles Into STEM Classrooms
DATE: October 31, 2024
CONTENT:
Even without access to a full makerspace, teachers can think creatively and bring ideas from maker education into their classes. Your content has been saved! After I taught a creative unit in my AP Physics class, a student wrote that they “really love this approach to learn physics differently… it was memorable to do something that is outside of solving AP problems.” This student perfectly summed up some of the reasons I like teaching in a makerspace, creating memorable experiences that translate into real-life applications of knowledge, not just problem-solving. I’m lucky that I’ve taught in schools with established makerspaces, and I get so excited to use the technology and help students be creative in the classroom. I’ve had so many different students tell me that making helped them to better understand content or that it made school more memorable or fun. However, having a makerspace in your school doesn’t necessarily mean you’ll use it, and not every school has a makerspace to begin with. You can still bring elements into your classroom, though. By taking some small steps, you can grow your skills as a maker and use making in your classroom with more confidence. Each year, I have students in my project-based physics course construct a freestanding paper tower. Students usually struggle to keep their towers upright with only paper and some tape. In one class, however, students watched Between the Folds, an hourlong documentary on origami and STEM. After watching the movie, my students made intricate folded towers that were significantly stronger than they had the year before. If you show students an interesting idea and then give them a project to utilize it, they will fill in the project with their enthusiasm and individual drive. By discovering that folding can make a stronger product, students could jump to new applications. These days, I foster creativity in a number of ways. I use theater games regularly in my class to keep the energy in the room engaged and excited. When my Engineering projects have design decisions, I make it a point to intentionally ask students to reflect on their decision and justify why. And I use artistic tools like visual scanning and artistic statements to help students see the connection between creativity and the work we are doing in the classroom. Maker education doesn’t need to have a huge amount of complex material or high-tech tools. For educators, practicing with small-scale projects can be a perfect way to learn how to help students in the makerspace—or in hands-on activities in the classroom. I taught my very first maker project in my first year of teaching. To show students how torque worked, we made mobiles using dollar-store products: plastic forks, beads, and key chains. The hardest part was tying knots onto slippery straws. But I learned so much by doing this little project! I learned about what materials to prepare, what questions to expect, how to help a student who finds the open-ended nature of the work frustrating. But mostly, it got me excited about other ways to teach the same content. The visual mobile helped students understand torque more deeply than any free-body diagram or YouTube video about engines. A good way to help students design is to start with small prototypes. Starting small can build to better project development. Several years ago, my engineering and design course had a major focus on “paper physics,” or origami devices that can help students understand physics topics. I taught them about Newton’s laws with paper airplanes, sound with paper poppers, and rotation with fidget spinners. Over time, I started to realize that I could build more complex fidget spinners with technology in the makerspace. Now, I rarely cover original topics inside of the paper physics unit and instead have students make fidget spinners, starting with origami, then cardboard, then a final laser-cut version. Practicing teaching with small units can help you develop more makerspace units in the future. Kids (of any age) love when their teachers share something that they love. My best makerspace projects have come from something creative that I shared with my students. I’ve written about my resin coaster project for Edutopia. The truth about that project is that I started making these coasters as gifts because I like working with resin. I was learning the laser cutter and thought of this application for my personal life, not my educator life. After doing it enough, I saw how this project would let me integrate art into STEM lessons, and I went for it. This year is my first year teaching chemistry in some time. Although working in a new course is hard, I’m excited to teach my students about stoichiometry because I have a great creative project tied to it: “s’more chemistry.” To help students understand the idea of the ratios of a chemical reaction, I have them think about the yield they can expect with a given “chemical reaction” (s’more recipe) and a volume of reactants. One of my mentor teachers taught this unit and even owned a food-safe Bunsen burner specifically to safely make s’mores with her students. This project teaches the idea of stoichiometry better than many more traditional lessons can. My excitement about it leads to better engagement and stronger content understanding. Makerspace teaching can have challenges different from those of a standard classroom. But the benefits for student learning and professional growth as a teacher are huge. I’ve seen so many students understand challenging concepts they might not have learned if not in a hands-on, practical setting. And for me as a teacher, makerspace teaching is varied and keeps me curious about every year and every classroom. Hopefully these small steps can help any teacher grow and become more confident in their making skills.

TITLE: Assessing the Child-Centeredness of Your Teaching in 6 Steps
DATE: December 16, 2024
CONTENT:
Early childhood teachers can use these strategies to align their teaching to students’ needs for optimal engagement and growth. Your content has been saved! A child-centered approach in early childhood education encourages teachers to create learning experiences that are responsive, engaging, and tailored to the unique development of each student. By placing the child at the heart of the learning process, we foster an environment where children are active participants in their own education, encouraged to explore, ask questions, and collaborate with peers. This approach is crucial because it supports not only academic growth but also emotional, social, and cognitive development, setting a strong foundation for lifelong learning. But how can we assess our teaching strategies to ensure that they are truly aligned with a child-centered approach? Below are six key steps to guide teachers in assessing and improving our practice within a child-centered framework. One of the first indicators of a successful child-centered classroom is learner engagement. Engaged children lead their learning process and become active participants in their own learning. They show curiosity, enthusiasm, and a desire to explore. For early years and primary school teachers, it’s important to observe how children interact with the content, activities, and each other; what questions come up; which aspects they are willing to learn more about; and what the teacher finds they need to develop more—content, strategies, or skills. The following are key reflection questions: Early years teachers need to observe and document how children respond to different contexts, activities, and teaching methods. By tuning in to the children’s level of engagement, we can adjust our approaches to maximize participation and enthusiasm. If children seem disengaged during group activities, we might introduce more hands-on, sensory experiences that connect directly to the children’s natural curiosity. For instance, in a session where children are learning about different types of leaves, including their shapes and textures, allow the learners to bring leaves to class. Gather the leaves into a single pile, and invite the children to work in teams to group the leaves according to their own criteria. A question to ask might be, “How would you arrange these leaves into smaller groups?” Then observe what the children do, interacting with each team to understand their reasoning. Afterward, share information about the different characteristics of the leaves, and eventually encourage the learners to reorganize the groups based on one or two of these characteristics. The learning environment is a critical element in a child-centered classroom. A well-designed setting will support children’s developmental needs, encourage exploration, and promote creativity. The space should be organized and welcoming, allowing children to feel safe, feel valued, develop ownership, and be motivated to engage in learning. The following are key evaluation questions: The design of a child-centered environment should stimulate imagination and foster learning through play, a key feature of early years education. We need to regularly assess whether the space is inclusive and provides opportunities for sensory, cognitive, and social development. In a child-centered approach, the curriculum needs to align with the interests, needs, and developmental stages of the children. Curriculum topics that are personally relevant to the learners will engage them more deeply and encourage a love for learning. We need to continuously evaluate the content to ensure that it resonates with the children’s lives, experiences, and curiosities. The following are key curriculum reflection questions: By incorporating children’s interests into the curriculum, we can create meaningful and engaging learning experiences. Asking children for feedback is a valuable practice in a child-centered classroom. Even young learners can share insights about their learning experiences, their preferences, and what they enjoy or find challenging. This feedback helps us make informed decisions about our teaching strategies and adjust the learning experience to better meet children’s needs. The following are ways to collect feedback: Consider creating opportunities for children to express their thoughts and feelings about the learning process. This could potentially empower them by giving them a voice, while they also offer insights that might help us adjust our approach to better support the children’s engagement and understanding. A child-centered approach makes it essential that we differentiate our instruction to meet the needs of every child. Consider asking yourself these key questions to guide differentiation: Differentiating instruction allows every child to learn at their own pace and ensures that each child receives the right level of support and challenge. We can also incorporate different methods of assessment to track progress and adjust instruction, whether through observation, work samples, or discussions with children. Collaboration with colleagues is an essential part of refining and enhancing a child-centered approach. Every teacher can benefit from collaborative planning sessions and participation in a professional learning community, especially when developing an approach that is new or less familiar. The following are key questions about collaboration: Working collaboratively not only supports personal growth but also helps ensure that teaching practices remain aligned with the principles of a child-centered approach across the school or early years setting. The child-centered approach fosters an environment where children are valued as active participants in their own learning. Prioritizing their unique needs, interests, and abilities reflects a deep respect for the child as an individual. It encourages teachers to listen to students, acknowledge their perspectives, and tailor learning experiences that support their growth, ultimately nurturing their confidence, independence, and love for learning.

TITLE: What a 30-Day Break From AI Taught Me About My Teaching
DATE: February 27, 2025
CONTENT:
Using AI became second nature for this educator. A month without the tools gave him an opportunity to pause, reflect, and recalibrate. Your content has been saved! On a crowded train home after a long day of teaching, I noticed a passenger frantically trying to retrieve an AirPod she’d dropped between the seats. My first instinct? Ask ChatGPT for a solution. This technological reflex took me by surprise. Why would I even think of ChatGPT in this situation? How could it possibly help? And should I be worried? This moment sparked “No AI December” (NOAID), an experimental monthlong detox from generative AI tools. Created by my friend Sandro Rybarik and me, what started as a playful experiment turned into a revealing journey into the cognitive costs of convenience—one that I, an advocate for responsible use of AI in education, now urge others to consider. Since ChatGPT’s launch in November 2022, educators have been divided on whether to embrace or ban AI use in schools. As a writing instructor at the University of New South Wales, I found ChatGPT increasingly useful in my work: inspiring lesson ideas, succinctly summarizing meetings, and speeding up my day-to-day processes. Many of my students found value in generative AI as well—using it to clarify challenging concepts, summarize complex academic reading, and provide feedback on their writing. But one day a student told me, “I can never seem to recall the research ChatGPT summarizes for me.” And when another admitted using ChatGPT to make their essays “sound more academic,” alarm bells rang. By using these tools to strip away their own voice, my student had bypassed the crucial learning opportunities that revision provides—a chance to tighten their logic, reevaluate evidence, and refine their ideas. While I understand why my students might reach for ChatGPT when writing and revising, I couldn’t help but think of a key principle from one of my favorite books on learning, Make It Stick: “Learning that’s easy is like writing in sand: here today and gone tomorrow.” The research on the impacts of cognitive offloading with AI tools is still in its early stages but growing. Studies like this one from Microsoft are beginning to raise red flags about AI’s effects on our mental faculties: Though generative AI did improve worker efficiency, this study suggests it may also diminish critical thinking, promoting long-term dependence and weakening independent problem-solving skills. While more evidence is needed, my monthlong AI detox experience seems to align with the current research. I do believe AI offers remarkable potential in education, but its casual overuse could be quietly eroding the valuable mental processes that have come to shape human learning. After I’d used generative AI tools almost daily for the past two years, life without them proved difficult. On the first day, I found myself missing the ease of having AI summarize a journal article or clarify an idea. Almost every bit of technology I used seemed to have AI baked in: Microsoft’s Office Suite, Outlook, Google Docs, LinkedIn, even my phone and internet browser. I started preparing for meetings, lessons, and workshops with pen and paper instead. This process slowed me down, quieting the ideas that normally pinballed through my head and dulling the temptation to reach for technology. Without AI-generated feedback, my first drafts were messier but far more authentic, genuinely capturing my ideas with much greater precision—a reminder of the value of process over product. And as a result, I’d managed to create a much firmer foundation for my own thinking. My pace and productivity undoubtedly slowed, but it felt like I was engaging in deeper work. Instead of asking ChatGPT for advice, I’d have to consult real human beings and wait for a response. This forced me to sit with my ideas longer, to wrestle with uncertainty and refine my own thinking. In many ways, the absence of instant answers became its own kind of teacher. In a world increasingly dominated by speed and efficiency, the return to a more tactile workflow reminded me that some of the most valuable insights come not from rushing to get things done, but in the messy, unhurried act of giving something my full and undivided attention. No AI December wasn’t about rejecting AI (or anyone’s decision to use it), but about recalibrating its role in my life. Today, I’ve gone back to using these tools in ways that are far more intentional. My goal is to try to preserve the messy, creative core of what it means to be an educator: curiosity, critical thinking, and the grit and energy to solve problems without always resorting to shortcuts—technological or otherwise. My hope is that my students will do the same. The challenge lies in designing classrooms where AI serves as a scaffold for innovation—enhancing, rather than replacing, intellectual rigor. Practice visible thinking: My experience reminded me of the widely applied pedagogy of “visible thinking.” Encourage students to lay out their thought processes, break down their reasoning, and explain how they arrived at their conclusions. For example, thinking routines like Think-Puzzle-Explore require students to articulate their questions, confront areas of confusion, and document their inquiry. This shifts focus from quick AI-generated answers to the value of productive intellectual struggle. By externalizing reasoning—through journals, annotations, or chat logs—students retain ownership of their learning, recognizing that true understanding often emerges through messy, human effort. Celebrate student voice: Many students are using AI to improve their writing for them, rather than with them. This often results in AI stripping their work of all nuance, criticality, and voice. Let students know you want to hear what they have to say in their own words. Consider including “voice” in grading criteria and assigning low-stakes writing opportunities with ongoing formative feedback to help elicit more authentic expression. Engaging students with informed and opinion-driven writing can encourage them to articulate their own ideas and see the value in thinking for themselves. Think before you prompt: We know that trying to solve a problem before being given the solution leads to better learning outcomes. Don’t allow brainstorming with AI to be the first thing your students do. When building foundational skills, consider having students occasionally unplug from technology entirely—drafting essays in class by hand or brainstorming on paper. Or ask students to journal or document their ideas prior to consulting with AI. Developing this habit is challenging but essential. You could even suggest an “AI delay” and ask students to spend 10–15 minutes (or more) generating ideas independently before turning to AI for additional support. Unplug and reconnect: Challenge yourself and your students to embark on an AI detox. Step away from AI tools where possible, and rediscover the power of human creativity and independent thought. Start a journal to document the journey, exploring questions like “How does it feel to rely solely on my own intellect?” or “What challenges arise when AI isn’t there to assist?” This activity can foster resilience, raise self-awareness, and cultivate a deeper appreciation for the human capacity to think, create, problem-solve, and innovate.

TITLE: How to Select Effective PD Facilitators
DATE: March 7, 2025
CONTENT:
An impactful coach—who may be among your staff—can make in-service days more meaningful and engaging for teachers. Your content has been saved! In my instructional innovation coaching work in schools, many school and district leaders need guidance on what to look for when selecting professional development (PD) facilitators for their in-service days, instructional coaching, and professional learning community meetings. They want to ensure that PD aligns with their district’s or school’s goals while encouraging teacher engagement and providing actionable strategies that educators can readily implement with students. We conduct quarterly instructional rounds for our PD to be data-driven and meaningful for teachers. After observing instruction in real time, we determine the improvement outcomes that we want to see in classrooms. Examples of solutions may include improvements in the following areas: We then develop our PD as interventions that support the solutions we identify. Since good PD is rarely one-size-fits-all, interventions should be tailored and provided to meet the needs of all the teaching staff. In our action research-based model, solutions address instructional problems, and PD interventions are the tools to support the implementation. When choosing the right PD facilitator(s), I always stress to leaders that it’s important to first seek out internal facilitators because it honors their in-house expertise. If the folks leading PD efforts in schools don’t create opportunities for passionate teachers to bloom and develop, they will most likely lose those talented folks. They may go elsewhere, to places that provide them more room to grow professionally. I have seen internal facilitators compensated for this work to honor their talent and the additional planning time occurring beyond their contracted teaching duties. Compensation conveys respect, builds trust, and increases confidence for the folks involved. Schools may at times need develop their internal talent, or seek experienced PD partners outside of their school or district. Regardless of where these facilitators are, it’s critical that school leaders do their due diligence to ensure that they choose the best possible collaborator for growing their teachers. 1. Expertise and experience. Determine that facilitators have demonstrable knowledge of the specific instructional or skills-based area(s) relevant to the teachers’ needs. Teachers don’t appreciate it when the PD facilitator doesn’t provide the success tools and modeling of the strategies they want and need for their classrooms. It’s also important for facilitators to make sure to leave some time for reflection after allowing teachers to practice. 2. Use of evidence-based practices. Coaching and PD interventions should be based on theory, research-backed methodologies, and sound practices that are proven to work in education. That doesn’t mean all strategies need to be facilitated precisely as they were originally designed—instead, facilitators should have know-how about customizing and personalizing on the fly. This means they clearly understand their objectives for facilitating and the rationale for using the practice(s) they’ve selected. 3. Customization and flexibility. Knowing how to tailor their existing workshops to meet your school’s unique needs and context is a vital quality in a PD facilitator. They must be flexible enough to adapt their approach based on your feedback and evolving circumstances. One way a facilitator can meet the unique needs of participants is to ask leaders to identify three desired outcomes for their teachers and their pain points or potential stumbling blocks in meeting those outcomes. This keeps the participants’ learning at the forefront of every aspect of workshop development. 4. Strong engagement and communication skills. It’s essential for PD facilitators to convey complex concepts clearly and effectively, while inspiring lively participation through interactive, fun, and reflective activities. Engagement can support participants’ learning, and good communication makes information easier to understand. Effective facilitators use conversational language—recognizing that not all educators are familiar with overly complex educational jargon. Skilled facilitators know how to make adjustments for their specific audiences. 5. Proven track record of success. An impactful PD facilitator has “receipts” (proof) of success in improving outcomes for participants and schools where they’ve coached and worked. Without the proper experience in a given topic or set of effective strategies, facilitators may struggle to appropriately coach others toward success. Ideally, they should be able to scientifically explain why what they’re doing is appropriate and have ample experience implementing said strategy within their own teaching context. Other examples of receipts might include significant time spent involved in aspects of instructional design, school leadership, and growing other educators pedagogically. High levels of experience and understanding help establish credibility with PD participants. 6. Collaborative approach. Successful PD facilitators show ease in working closely with your team to understand your goals, challenges, and school culture. They’ll know that taking the time to fully comprehend the situational context where they’ll be working will help them plan and deliver relevant and meaningful PD. Through level-setting meetings with leadership, surveys, and visiting the school website, they may get a clearer picture of the support that teachers need. This is especially crucial for outside facilitators, who will be less familiar with the school’s instructional priorities and culture. 7. Consistent support and follow-up. Instructional innovation is continuous, and PD will most likely be implemented over time. Good facilitators provide ongoing support, resources, and follow-up to ensure that the new learning is properly implemented. One-and-done coaching rarely suffices—sustained support is critical as teachers implement because some may need additional feedback, guidance, and support. That doesn’t mean that the PD facilitator is on call 24/7. It means that they’ve provided a set of resources that participants can refer back to as they implement their new learning. Ideally, PD facilitators also provide opportunities for follow-up feedback at a designated time—such as sustained coaching opportunities set up after the teachers had chances to implement. These opportunities are typically set up with the folks who brought them in. As school teams work to identify good facilitators for their next in-service day, remember that great facilitators aren’t born—they develop over time. Some of your internal talent may not possess all of the above qualities, but you can allow them to facilitate if they have the one(s) essential for your PD. Here’s a facilitator’s rubric I created with help from ChatGPT, available for download. PD facilitators can use it as a self-assessment tool to gauge where they are currently and as they develop their skill sets.

In education, this means that small, deliberate adjustments to the classroom can have outsized effects on students’ motivation and engagement. These changes are easy to implement and can yield noticeable results without draining your energy or theirs. Consider this: Why do people take the stairs when the elevator is broken? It’s not because they suddenly decide to prioritize fitness—it’s because the environment nudges them in that direction. In the classroom, we can use the same approach by designing spaces that nudge students into desired behaviors. One of the simplest ways to boost student motivation is by removing small barriers that hinder engagement. Behavioral science shows that even tiny obstacles can have a significant impact. For example, in an experiment where both bananas and oranges were placed in a bowl, people overwhelmingly chose bananas—not for their taste, but because they were easier to peel. Likewise, eliminating these “peeling problems” in education can lead to substantial improvements in student motivation. The first factor in improving design is thinking of the obstacles that are stopping engagement from being easy. Even minor inconveniences—like missing supplies—can derail focus in the classroom. By reducing barriers, we make it easier for students to start and stick with their work. In my English classroom, I’ve created a Grab-and-Go Station stocked with everything students might need: pencils, pens, highlighters, sticky notes, and even paper. If a student forgets something, they don’t need to ask or waste time searching; they simply head to the station and grab what they need. This simple adjustment has saved countless lessons from interruptions and has made students more self-sufficient. I also encourage students to restock the station as part of our classroom community responsibilities, reinforcing ownership and respect for shared resources. Our brains are wired to respond to visual triggers. A cleverly placed visual cue can prompt action more effectively than a dozen verbal reminders. Research on visual processing shows that these cues bypass mental clutter, making desired behaviors automatic. One strategy I use is a “Question Parking Lot” in my classroom—a whiteboard where students can post questions or advice during independent practice. While working, students must jot down at least one question they’re stuck on or a tip that’s helped them understand the material. For instance, during a lesson on analyzing themes, a student might write, “What does ‘universal theme’ mean?” or “Breaking the passage into smaller parts helped me find the theme.” At the end of the lesson, we revisit the parking lot as a group. This not only gives me insight into where students are struggling but also encourages them to engage more deeply with the material. Additionally, visual cues can help turn reflection into a habit and foster a supportive learning community. In my classroom, I’ve established clearly labeled zones with specific expectations to help students transition smoothly. Labels such as “Quiet Zone,” “Collaboration Area,” and “Turn-In Bin” serve as constant, nonverbal reminders of what’s expected in each space. This simple system minimizes the need for repeated instructions and allows students to move effortlessly between activities. Curiosity is a powerful motivator. Research shows that when students are intrigued, they’re more likely to dive into their work willingly—and even enjoy the process. Before lessons, I post an intriguing question or fun fact on the board. For example, before starting a unit on figurative language, I wrote, “Which phrase was once banned in 19th-century France—‘raining cats and dogs’ or ‘a piece of cake’?” Students couldn’t wait to find out the answer, and that curiosity carried over into the lesson. Posting a visual cue or hook motivates students and helps sustain engagement during the lesson. We often focus so much on the end goal that we forget to celebrate the small wins along the way. Creating a visual space to recognize progress is critical for maintaining momentum, especially with long-term projects or challenging material. In my classroom, we track progress on a “Living Wall”—a shared space where students post sticky notes highlighting their achievements. For example, when we’re analyzing texts, students might post their best theme analysis from the week. This visual record of progress boosts confidence and reminds students that learning is a journey made up of small, meaningful steps. Motivation doesn’t have to be a battle of wills. By reducing friction, using visual cues, sparking curiosity, and celebrating progress, you can create a classroom environment where engagement and success feel natural. You’ll be amazed at how these seemingly minor changes can lead to big results—not just in your students’ motivation, but also in their confidence and enthusiasm for learning. And remember: Sometimes, the best way to inspire isn’t to push harder—it’s to design smarter.

TITLE: Maintaining Students’ Focus in the Spring
DATE: March 3, 2025
CONTENT:
Teachers can use these small ‘upgrades’ or tweaks to their regular practices to help keep students focused and involved. Your content has been saved! Getting through the second half of the year can be difficult. Just this week, I was visiting a department meeting and the chair was reminding teachers that right around now, students need more support to maintain their stamina, interest, and sense of well-being. In the second half of the school year, kids often experience a downward slide in achievement as their engagement and stamina decline and dysregulation increases. As a recent MindShift article notes, “The second semester brings a lot of potential challenges to teachers’ regularly scheduled programming because of standardized testing, graduation events, and student burnout.” These challenges may be complex, but they are not insurmountable. With subtle shifts in practice, classrooms can remain safe and productive spaces—even in the spring. Students are wired to focus more on the transient motivation of grades over feedback, which is a mindset that results in disengagement if grades start to drop. Research shows that when students see grades before feedback, they tend to ignore constructive comments, leading to further declines in performance. For example, a more basic grading approach that teachers might take is to leave strings of comments on student work, which often either go misunderstood or are unread entirely. Upgrade: Grades and feedback often get conflated with one another, but where the former is an evaluative measure, feedback is an objective determination of student progress toward specific criteria for success. Teachers are short on time, which can elevate grades at the expense of a more meaningful feedback process. To make room for helping students gain a deeper understanding of what they need to accomplish to be successful, we can leverage what little time there is each day by shifting the focus from summative grading to formative feedback. Suppose students have created research presentations about the role of carbon in photosynthesis in their science class. A teacher might return the presentations with strings of comments or an inexplicable grade attached. Instead, the teacher can provide feedback on a list of criteria that students have had from the start of the presentation process with items such as these: Provided that students have this list of criteria in advance, not only will their presentations be more likely to meet the expected standard, but also the feedback process will be more streamlined for the teacher. The lower levels of frustration that result from added clarity will ease the type of burnout that both teachers and students feel as achievement atrophies in the second part of the school year. By midyear, students may lose interest in their classes. They might find that the routines are repetitive or that there is no real connection between the course content and their personal experience. This also decreases meaningful cognitive engagement, which hurts student performance. Teachers might try to improve matters by attempting to tap into student interest, but such shifts are often temporary or too superficial to make any kind of lasting change. Upgrade: Although nurturing student interests is certainly important, this approach has limited power to create lasting engagement. Too often, teachers over-scaffold instruction or lower their standards. To make change, two priorities must be in place: The first is to make sure that the work itself is both engaging and meaningful, and the second is to elevate student voice and choice. When teachers elicit more profound levels of engagement, we must ensure that there is ample opportunity to engage in higher-order thinking about grade-level content. One way to incorporate this practice into any classroom is to give students ample guidance for asking questions. Suppose that a sixth-grade social studies teacher is about to complete a daily lesson about the cultural practices of ancient Greece. Instead of summarizing the learning for students, a far more engaging move is to ask students to craft (and perhaps answer) higher-order thinking questions about what they got from the lesson, such as “What important values in ancient Greece are still part of our culture today?” Not only can the teacher collect these questions to determine next steps; ideally, students also have time to stand up, find a partner or a small group, and share their questions with one another so that everyone in the room is participating and engaged. To create a learner-centered space that prioritizes student choice, we can introduce projects or more active opportunities for hands-on learning that tie lessons to topics that students find relevant. For example, if high school students are frustrated with the lack of representation in how the Renaissance is discussed in European history, they could do a project to explore artists of the period whose work is lesser known because of their racial or ethnic background. This type of learning opportunity is driven by choice and is therefore more likely to increase both interest and engagement. Students are not always more comfortable midway through the school year. Many secondary students switch classes and teachers at the midpoint, which causes instability. Also, the winter months can increase feelings of depression or anxiety, and the springtime can be a significant distraction in its own way as students become more restless. Students may therefore be more likely to experience emotional dysregulation, leading to classroom disruptions or feelings of being undervalued. In such instances, teachers might address what is happening with individual students when a more classwide approach is appropriate. Upgrade: Students feel more grounded if teachers implement strategies that set everyone up for success the moment they enter the classroom. For example, dedicating a few minutes at the start of class to frame the learning with an accessible activator increases confidence for learning. Suppose a middle school student who reads slowly is nervous because she didn’t have time to finish an assigned article about the rise of Mussolini. Instead of starting class with a reading check or activity that is focused on accountability, the teacher begins with questions that are general to the themes of the reading and that all students can answer, such as “What does it mean to have power? In what ways have you seen people abuse their power?” We can also create spaces within their classrooms that normalize the management of anxiety. For my most recent book, I interviewed social worker and author Phyllis Fagell about how students can more effectively manage their feelings. She recommends a “coping jar” to help students identify moments of angst and manage their feelings. Fagell explains that when students find an effective coping mechanism, they write their idea on one side of a Popsicle stick and explain how it works on the other side. As students add ideas to the jar, they have an increased awareness of coping strategies and the importance of helping one another. With the recognition of the challenges that kids face and upgrades that make classroom life a little better, we all have the power to help our students see this school year through successfully.

TITLE: Question: Is AI Harmful to Education?
DATE: February 26, 2025
CONTENT:
Your content has been saved! Where do you stand on AI? Back in 2023, the Pew Research Center asked K-12 teachers about how they view the use of AI tools: Is AI harmful to education? While a large percentage were either uncertain or on the fence, 25 percent drew a clear line in the sand declaring the tools cause "more harm than benefit." A very small percentage, only six percent of educators, said they believe AI tools provide “more benefit than harm.” Views tend to differ by school level, writes Luona Lin, a Pew research associate. When asked “is AI harmful,” high school teachers, for example, are “more likely than elementary and middle school teachers to hold negative views about AI tools in education.” It’s probable that older students have more opportunities in the upper grades to utilize the technology, and many have found a number of use cases. In a separate survey, 69 percent of teens familiar with the tool say it’s “acceptable to use it to research new topics,” while 39 percent believe it’s acceptable to solve math problems with the tools and 20 percent think it’s fine to use the tool to write essays.

TITLE: How to Support Floating Teachers
DATE: February 13, 2025
CONTENT:
Schools can create shared space for teachers who travel from classroom to classroom, giving them room for storage and planning. Your content has been saved! Floating or nomadic teachers, los profesores nómadas (as I like to call them), are the ones without a fixed classroom. The ones with trolleys full of materials, moving from one classroom to another, with nowhere to truly call home. They include specialists, music, art, English as a second language (ESL), or support teachers, who carry their lessons on wheels or in backpacks, navigating crowded hallways, hoping to find what they need when they arrive. Let’s be real—teaching on the move can be dynamic and rewarding, but without the right support, it also can became overwhelming. I know this firsthand. I’ve walked into classrooms where I couldn’t find a whiteboard marker, where my materials were missing, where I had to start a lesson while also rearranging tables sticky with leftover snacks. It can be exhausting. But it doesn’t have to be this way. Administrators can create the right environment so that nomad teachers can thrive—even when the school is short on space. Imagine this: A teacher enters a classroom, carrying a heavy trolley full of resources. They have five minutes to set up before the next class starts. Maybe they need the screen that the primary teacher is still using, or they find that the cable for the projector isn’t working. Or they planned an art lesson, but the tables are still full of crumbs from morning snack. This was my everyday reality. I remember juggling a set of rhythm sticks in one hand and a laptop in the other, trying to log in to a projector before realizing the HDMI was gone. Or having to rework a hands-on activity because the space just wasn’t set up for it. Nomadic teachers become experts in adaptation. They are flexible, resourceful, and dedicated, but this level of adjustment comes with a cost: And yet, these teachers are essential. So why aren’t we designing our buildings in a way that helps them do their job better? Let’s not forget: These teachers are the glue of the school. While most teachers spend their days with one class or a specific grade, nomadic teachers are everywhere. A music teacher might bring rhythm and melody into the lives of every student in the building. An ESL teacher isn’t just teaching English; they’re bridging languages and cultures, making connections that ripple across classrooms and communities. When nomadic teachers thrive, the whole school benefits. So, how can we support them? Start by asking them. Instead of assuming what they need, school leaders should ask these questions: Even simple solutions, like a better trolley, a designated shelf in each classroom, a cupboard in each hallway of the school, or a smoother transition schedule, can have a huge impact. But these ideas only work if they actually meet the needs of the people using them. That’s where a shared workroom comes in: a simple but important solution that really helps to support teachers who don’t have a permanent classroom. Unlike a general teachers’ lounge, this space is designed specifically for those teachers constantly on the move, giving them a reliable spot to land between classes. Instead of teachers having to scramble in the hallway or borrow a corner of someone else’s classroom, these workrooms are stocked with what teachers actually need: storage, prep areas, and a moment of calm between transitions. Of course, every school is different, and the best way to create a useful shared workroom is to ask the teachers what they need. Here are some key elements that could make this space effective: Ideally, the school administration or a designated coordinator should take care of the shared workroom (or their alternative solutions), ensuring that it remains functional and organized and truly serves its purpose: supporting these teachers so they can continue supporting everyone else. However, I understand that not all schools have the extra space to designate an area solely for nomadic teachers. In cases where a shared workroom isn’t possible, smaller adjustments can still make a big difference. For example, creating “landing spots” throughout the school—a small desk, cupboard, or storage bin in classrooms or hallways—can provide teachers with consistent, accessible spaces for their materials and planning. I’ve worked in schools where I had everything I needed to do my job well, and in others where I spent more time looking for materials than actually teaching. The difference? Thoughtful planning. When teachers, especially nomadic ones, feel supported, they can focus on what really matters: engaging students, building connections, and making learning meaningful. The good news is that it doesn’t take a huge budget or a huge renovation to make a difference. Just a little intention, a bit of space, and a willingness to ask the right questions.

Paris Kent, the dance director at Bellaire High School in Houston, has sent her students into physics classes to help students learn about the rotation of an axis through the movement of their bodies, demonstrating how a person’s size impacts the speed of the rotation. It’s just one way Kent works to incorporate dance across the curriculum. But the methods for utilizing movement are just as plentiful as the reasons for doing so—from giving students an opportunity to share elements of their culture, creating connections between students and their teachers, and increasing student engagement. Here, Kent shares how teachers can incorporate dance and movement into their classrooms in small, time-effective ways.

Encampments, like the one shown here at the University of Wisconsin–Madison in April 2024, are relatively unpopular, with 40 percent of survey respondents saying they are never an acceptable form of protest. Lawrence Iles/Icon Sportswire via Getty Images Ten months after pro-Palestinian encampments sprang up across U.S. college campuses, sparking backlash from politicians, university leaders and pro-Israel students and faculty, the public is still extremely critical of student protests, according to new research conducted by the Center for Applied Research in Education at the University of Southern California. Conducted from October to December 2024, the survey asked 4,200 adults whether they thought certain student “free speech actions,” including criticizing their universities online, protesting world events by walking out of class or occupying campus buildings, were always, sometimes or never appropriate. More than half of respondents said several of the examples were never appropriate: leaving protest messages on property, shouting down speakers, occupying buildings in protest and disrupting graduation, which was the least popular protest action, with about eight in 10 people saying it was never appropriate. Even actions like criticizing their university on social media were relatively unpopular, with only 13 percent of respondents saying it’s always appropriate to do so and 38 percent saying it’s never appropriate. Respondents were far more likely to approve of universities’ steps to stop protests, with 86 percent saying it was sometimes or always OK for police to arrest students who were breaking the law. Only slightly fewer, 79 percent, said it would be OK for police to break up a student protest—and the question didn’t even specify whether or not laws were broken. Over all, every example of an institution’s response to protests received a higher approval rating than any example of a protest action. “I would say the low levels of support for unqualified free speech, that definitely surprised me,” said Morgan Polikoff, one of the researchers on the project, which was funded by the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation. “There are not a lot of free speech universalists out there, I would say that. The results make that pretty clear.” The survey did not ask about specific causes, but Polikoff speculated that the pro-Palestinian protests that reached a head last spring were likely top of mind for most respondents. Still, though they dominated the news cycle at the time, encampments earned only moderate condemnation from respondents, with 40 percent saying they were never acceptable. About the same share—41 percent—said they were sometimes an appropriate form of protest. Free speech experts and historians say the results aren’t particularly surprising; throughout history, older people have often criticized student protests in America, going back to at least the 1920s, according to Robert Cohen, a professor of history and social studies at New York University and a fellow at the National Center for Free Speech and Civic Engagement. “Movements like the freedom rides in ’61, the Free Speech Movement at Berkeley—all of them were unpopular. All of them,” he said. “Why is that? It’s because the culture of the country, when it comes to youth, is pretty conservative. Students, their role is to go to school, obey orders and come home. That’s what they’re supposed to do. Students who are protesting are breaking away from that role that they’re supposed to play.” Indeed, older respondents were far more likely than younger ones to oppose various types of student protests; 18- to 34-year-olds were three times more likely to always approve of encampments than those over 65, for example. Republicans were also generally more opposed to student free speech and more accepting of shutting down protests—although not by massive margins in every case. Angus Johnston, a historian of student protests and a professor at Hostos Community College in New York, said that some of the protest actions that received the most condemnation surprised him—including the 76 percent of respondents who said it’s never appropriate to write messages on institutional property. While that category includes permanent graffiti, he noted, it also includes chalking on sidewalks. “One of the distinctions that I think is really important to draw is a distinction between protest that is disruptive and protest that is destructive. One may fall in opposition of both or in favor of both, but I think that is an important distinction to draw. The idea that somebody chalking outside or even on the wall of an administration building is somehow hugely beyond the pale [is something] that I would have liked to see this study look a little bit deeper into,” he said. The report also touches on public approval of diversity, equity and inclusion programs, which varied more sharply by political party. The majority of Democrats found all four examples of DEI in higher education sometimes or always appropriate: 82 percent approved of required DEI training, 76 percent of hiring DEI staff, 73 percent of requiring DEI coursework and 54 percent of requiring DEI statements. While Republicans were much more likely to call such practices inappropriate, DEI appears more popular—or at least accepted—among party members than one might assume, given President Donald Trump’s efforts to eliminate it from higher education. For example, more than half of Republicans said DEI training was sometimes (29 percent) or always (22 percent) appropriate. (This story has been updated to correct the number of survey respondents.)

Several colleges have recently moved to pause or reduce graduate student admissions. Scott Olson/Getty Images Several colleges and universities are pausing admissions to some graduate programs, reducing class sizes or rescinding offers to students in an effort to cut costs amid uncertainty in federal funding. The disruption to graduate school admissions is the latest cost-cutting move for colleges. After the National Institutes of Health proposed cutting reimbursements for costs related to research, several colleges and universities said they would pause hiring and cut spending, Inside Higher Ed previously reported. (A federal judge has blocked the NIH plan from taking effect for now.) In recent days, the University of Pittsburgh, the University of Pennsylvania and several other institutions have stopped doctoral admissions, at least temporarily. Some colleges are pausing admissions to some programs such as in the biomedical sciences, Stat News reported. At others, the pause is universitywide. The University of Southern California and Vanderbilt University temporarily paused graduate student admissions, though both universities later said that they’d ended the pause. A University of Pittsburgh spokesperson told WESA, a local NPR station, that the university “temporarily paused additional Ph.D. offers of admission until the impacts of that [NIH] cap were better understood … the University is in the process of completing that analysis and expects to be in a position to resume offers soon.” Meanwhile, the University of Pennsylvania is planning to cut graduate admissions rates, The Daily Pennsylvanian reported, citing an email from the interim dean of the School of Arts and Sciences, Jeffrey Kallberg, who wrote that the cuts were a “necessary cost-saving measure” to adjust to the NIH proposal. “This is not a step any of us wanted to take,” Kallberg wrote, according to the Daily Penn. “We recognize that graduate students are central to the intellectual life of our school—as researchers, teachers, collaborators, and future scholars. However, we must ensure that we can continue to provide strong support for those students currently in our programs and sustain the school’s core teaching and research activities.” Tom Kimbis, executive director of the National Postdoctoral Association, wrote in an email to Inside Higher Ed that academic institutions reliant on federal funding “are being forced to make tough decisions to support these researchers in a difficult environment.” “The decisions in Washington to pause or cease funding for science and research is impacting early-career researchers across a wide range of disciplines,” Kimbis added. “Slowing or stopping their work, on topics from cancer and Alzheimer’s research to social science issues, hurts Americans in all 50 states.” In the last week, some faculty began tracking the reductions in the biomedical sciences via a shared spreadsheet that includes verified cuts and unverified decisions based on word of mouth and internal emails. Faculty on social media said the cuts will have long-term ramifications for sciences as fewer students enter the field. On TikTok, several students who had applied to grad school shared their dismay at how the funding cuts meant they might have to say goodbye to their career plans and research. Accepting graduate students, particularly for Ph.D. programs and in the biomedical sciences, requires universities to make a long-term financial commitment, which is more difficult now that the NIH has stopped making new grant awards and is aiming to cut funds. Colleges receive billions from the NIH to support research. If the proposed rate cuts move forward, institutions say they would have to shut down some labs and lay off employees. “University research and scholarship operate on a time scale of years and decades,” the Rutgers AAUP-AFT chapter wrote in a letter to New Jersey senators Cory Booker and Andy Kim. “Higher education would become impossible in the face of capricious and arbitrary withholding of funding, elimination of entire areas of grant support for critical scientific research, and cancellation of long-held contracts.” They went on to warn that the threat to funding would diminish the country’s strength as a research superpower. “The best scientists, the best scholars, and the best students will make the rational decision to take their talents elsewhere. Once lost, the historic excellence of United States universities, including world-leading institutions in New Jersey, both public and private, will not be easily regained.”

Pepperdine University students showed their differing views on abortion on the campus Freedom Wall in 2021, ahead of the Supreme Court decision striking down Roe v. Wade. The Freedom Wall allows students to start discussions and engage in civil discourse. Samantha Torre/Pepperdine Graphic Media College campuses are centers of learning and discussion in the community, and sometimes the epicenter of youth political movements. Recent protests related to Israel’s war in Gaza have spurred new conversations among campus leaders about how to protect students’ First Amendment rights while creating a safe environment for all learners to engage. A December Student Voice survey by Inside Higher Ed and Generation Lab asked college students what actions, out of a list of 11 responses, would be most helpful in promoting civil dialogue on campus or educating students on the importance of free expression. The most popular answer (43 percent) was creating designated spaces or forums on campus for students to share their opinions. Despite how popular these spaces are among students, providing specific areas for student discourse is rare or more focused on restricting protests. Inside Higher Ed compiled four examples of physical forums and other constructive spaces on campus to promote free expression and learning among college students. Free speech zones: Some college campuses have created free speech zones, which restrict protest or other expressive activities to a designated space. Critics of these spaces have compared them to quarantines, pushing speakers to the fringes of campus, and they take issue with college leaders’ pre-approval of any public political expression. Recent legislation introduced in Congress this past year would eliminate free speech zones and require institutions to disclose their free speech and freedom of association policies to campus community members, among other requirements. The bill passed in the House in September. Physical spaces: Towson University in Maryland is home to the Freedom Square, which provides community members the opportunity to express and deliberate issues of civic concern, according to the university’s website. Within the square, students can hang out or study on one of the stone benches or share their thoughts on two large chalkboards. The university established the space in 2011. Otis College of Art and Design and Pepperdine University are both institutions that have a designated Freedom Wall for students to engage in civic dialogue via creative expression. The two colleges take different approaches with how students can engage in the wall. Students at Otis forfeit ownership of their work once posted on the wall, but Pepperdine protects students’ posts until at least Friday at 5 p.m. At Otis, students express themselves directly on the wall, attaching objects or painting on the surface. At Pepperdine, students post to a corkboard. Free speech forums: Other institutions are investing in academic centers that can promote civic discourse and constructive dialogue among learners. Arizona State University will launch an annual Free Speech Forum this spring, housed in the university’s Center for Free Speech, which “will engage students, faculty and the broader community and bring in national speakers on free speech,” according to a university press release. Student groups can also facilitate spaces for open discussion. At Emory University’s school of law, the Emory Free Speech Forum “discusses important issues in law and society … with the belief that the best answers are found through unfettered debate.” How does your campus create space for constructive dialogue on campus?
