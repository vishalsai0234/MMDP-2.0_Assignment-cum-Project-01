Reviewed by Margaret Foley High-performance environments in different professions may initially appear different on the surface, but the psychological demands placed on executives and athletes can be incredibly similar. Although there are different high-performance environments, many of the issues high performers face overlap in their respective settings. Athletes and executives are different types of high performers who experience many of the same challenges, whether on the field or in a boardroom. Whether you’re experiencing long days out on the court or with other C-suite executives, you must possess the ability to execute sustained high performance. The mental strategies that drive success in one domain can absolutely be applied to the other. Many high achievers have the misconception that if they work harder, they can achieve more and experience greater success. This is true for the athlete who believes that practicing an hour or two more per day will lead to better on-court performance, as well as the business professional who thinks putting in that extra hour on email will move the needle. Research shows that strategic breaks, as well as intentional rest and recovery, can improve performance rather than hinder it. To show the importance of taking breaks to achieve peak performance, a study by K. Anders Ericsson and his colleagues found that top performers, such as musicians, athletes, and chess players, often practice in intervals of no more than 90 minutes, taking breaks between sessions. This “work-recovery” approach can also be utilized in corporate settings, where taking regular breaks can result in the maintenance of high productivity and focus. In another study, researchers at the University of Illinois discovered that prolonged attention to a single task hinders performance. Taking short breaks can help to reset and refresh the brain, leading to better mental health and well-being. Executives who embrace this concept can see measurable benefits in their ability to think strategically, make better decisions, and sustain long-term success. In business and sports, setbacks and challenges are not an if but a when. Athletes go through this as they experience trades, injuries, performance slumps, and career uncertainties. Executives, on the other hand, experience failed ventures, leadership challenges, and team turnover. How can one overcome these obstacles and achieve success? This is done through developing mental resilience—the ability to adapt, recover, and refocus. Another tool that both athletes and executives utilize is the power of routine. Many of the world's top professionals in business and sports follow a structured routine that prioritizes both physical and mental recovery. Just like they use certain strategies at work and plays during a game, they also prioritize rest and recovery strategies. Whether you're an executive running a large company or an athlete playing in a professional sports league, integrating high-performance habits is an absolute must to enhance both your physical and mental endurance. Here are three key takeaways you can implement today to start incorporating the high-performance habits practiced by some of the most successful athletes and entrepreneurs in the world: References Ericsson, KA. Deliberate practice and the acquisition and maintenance of expert performance: a general overview, Acad Emerg. Med. 2008, 988-994. Ariga, A., & Lleras, A. (2011). Brief and rare mental "breaks" keep you focused: deactivation and reactivation of task goals preempt vigilance decrements. Cognition, 118(3), 439–443. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cognition.2010.12.007

TITLE: Is "Paying Attention" Overrated for Kids?

Reviewed by Tyler Woods Last week at my neighborhood park, I watched a seven-year-old boy seemingly "not paying attention" during his outdoor science lesson. While his teacher was explaining plant life cycles, he was looking everywhere but at her diagram—at ants crawling near the roots, at the way sunlight filtered through leaves, at how the wind moved different branches. Later, this same "distracted" child explained photosynthesis by connecting all these observations. What looked like inattention was actually a different, more holistic form of engagement. A new study offers insight into how this process works. Children's attention and learning might operate differently than ours—not better or worse, but not the same. If you've been in a classroom recently, or worked with a child on homework, you've probably heard—or said, "Just focus, okay?" You've probably seen the ways kids are jumping up to do a million other things, or noticing the bluebird flying outside the window instead of working on their projects. To us, it appears to be plain and simple distraction—but as this study suggests, kids and adults might actually learn and focus differently. Kids may be less good at paying selective attention, or noticing only one thing, but they may tend to be better at absorbing more from the world. As a speech pathologist and author of The Art of Talking with Children, I'm very interested in how we have conversations with kids and how those conversations help their learning, social skills, and relationships. I'm also very aware of how stressful it can be, whether as a parent, caregiver, or teacher, to feel as if kids aren't paying attention "right." How will they ever learn, we might wonder? This new study offers insight. The study, which appeared in Psychological Science in 2024, showed that kids tended to learn information just as well when they were asked to ignore it as when they were asked to focus on it. In this study, researchers Marlie Tandoc at the University of Pennsylvania and colleagues studied children ages 7 to 9 and adults. The researchers asked participants either to attend to drawings of common objects or simply notice when shapes repeated. The first finding wasn't surprising. When everyone was asked to attend to the drawings, the adults learned the drawings better than the children. But when everyone was asked not to attend to them—that is, just to notice if shapes repeated—children showed better learning in the test's first half. Just as interesting, the children learned the drawings just as well when they weren't asked to pay attention to them as when they were. As the researchers asked, "Why can children achieve certain learning feats that many adults cannot?" In part, it seems because they attend to many factors in their environment simultaneously. Rather than paying attention primarily to what they are told to, their attention seems to be more roving, as they explore their environments. This allows them to notice, for instance, both the ways someone is solving a problem on the board and the ways their friend is drawing an animal in his notebook. Also, interestingly, the researchers suggest that "instructions play even less of a role in children's learning than was previously thought." Telling children, in this case, what they ought to attend to didn't change how much they learned. That means that learning, for them, might actually look more to us like moving around their rooms or their environments, picking up different cues. They may be attending to novelty, to what catches their eyes—and this attention to novelty may help them learn. Their lack of selective attention, in this case, may actually be a strength. This isn't an argument for them to be totally "unfocused" or running around the room instead of sitting. It also is only one study, and clearly has limitations in terms of what students were being asked to learn. There are certainly situations where directed attention is crucial: when learning about safety procedures, crossing streets, or following specific sequences, for example. But even in these cases, children might be absorbing information differently than we expect. What I find most interesting about this research is how it raises the question: "might children learn in a way that looks and feels different from us?" And if they do, perhaps we need to shift our stance. Rather than telling children only to "pay attention," we might offer alternatives that will interest them and help them pay closer attention. For instance, consider having interesting things on the wall or in the environment that support their deeper learning on the topic. Here's what this might look like in practice: When helping a child with reading comprehension, you see he’s constantly fidgeting and looking around. Instead of repeatedly redirecting him to the page, try taking a break and letting him explore the room. See what connections you can make to the story he’s been reading. Perhaps there is a man in the story looking out the window. Does what he sees seem similar to what your child sees? What is different? Before going back to reading, ask the child to predict what else might be similar or different. What does she think will happen next in the story? Why? With the movement break and the chance to make new connections, you may find her engaging with the story in a deeper way. More broadly, we may need to rethink the way we talk to kids about learning and distraction. Instead of berating them for not paying attention as we do, we might instead help channel their energy, noticing new things for example, but not so many new things that it overwhelms them. Maybe instead of asking, "Pay attention," consider, "What else do you notice?" or "How does that new piece of information relate to what we are learning?" This can start a far richer conversation—and help children learn more deeply. It's a worthwhile shift in terms of our relationship, too. Instead of a battle for attention, consider working with children's natural curiosities, engaging them with what they are learning, and with other aspects of the environment as well. What changes might you make this week to support the natural learning patterns of the children in your life? Could you create learning environments with varied stimuli that support your core topic? Might you experiment with asking different questions that harness rather than suppress their wandering attention? The results might surprise you—and transform learning from a battle of wills into a journey of discovery. References For more about me and my work, see my website and newsletter.

Reviewed by Margaret Foley As I looked around the dining table, I saw it. I felt it. I loved it. And I will never forget it. Because what I witnessed was pure magic—radiant, undeniable, and filled with goodness. What I saw was the beauty of soulful sisterhood. A few years ago, my closest and dearest friends gathered with me to celebrate a milestone—my bachelorette. It was a weekend infused with deep conversations, playful debates, and spontaneous dance moves. It was an unforgettable time brimming with warmth and love. But there was something even more extraordinary about that weekend. It wasn’t the way they showered me with love (though I cherished every moment). It wasn’t the heartfelt words they spoke (which moved me beyond measure). It wasn’t even the hilarious confessions, the uninhibited laughter, or the dance moves so fierce they belonged on a stage. No, the most magical part of the weekend was witnessing the unspoken bond of soulful sisterhood. These women came from different chapters of my life—each unique, each with their own story. They were of different ages, from different cultures, and on different life paths. They had little in common other than me, yet they connected effortlessly. Why? Because they understood the unspoken rules of soulful sisterhood—rules built on respect, kindness, curiosity, and above all, love. It made me wonder—what if the whole world operated on these rules? What if we all embraced the principles of soulful sisterhood, regardless of gender or background? Surely, the world would be a kinder, more compassionate place. When I reflected on what these unspoken rules truly meant, I realized they extended far beyond friendships among women. They are universal principles that can help foster deeper, more meaningful connections in any relationship. If you’re looking to create bonds that uplift and empower, here’s what truly matters: 1. Celebrate each other’s differences. Instead of allowing differences to divide us, we should embrace them as gifts. Every person brings a unique perspective, experience, and essence to the table. True sisterhood recognizes that diversity strengthens our connections rather than weakens them. 2. Be curious, not judgmental. Instead of rushing to conclusions, take the time to understand one another. Ask questions, listen deeply, and approach others with a genuine desire to learn about their choices, lifestyles, and beliefs. Compassion grows where curiosity thrives. 3. Accept and encourage authenticity. The strongest bonds are built on the freedom to be unapologetically oneself. Support and encourage those around you to show up as their truest selves, without fear of rejection or judgment. When we feel accepted, we shine. 4. Lift each other higher. True sisterhood is not a competition—it’s a collaboration. Celebrate successes, amplify voices, and help each other rise. There is infinite space at the top when we climb together. 5. Offer unwavering support. Life is unpredictable, filled with highs and lows. Be the person who stands beside others through every challenge and triumph. A strong sisterhood provides a foundation of support that turns struggles into strength. Now, take a moment to cherish your own soulful sisterhood. Tell them how much you love and appreciate them. Keep them close, always. “Love is the essence of being a woman. We must be that light of love that seals the bond and unique beauty of our sisterhood.” —Bindu

Reviewed by Margaret Foley Personal finance advice is everywhere. It’s in best-selling books, viral social media posts, and motivational speeches that promise to unlock the secret to wealth and happiness. In my experience, these so-called financial gurus tend to fall into two camps, each preaching a different path to financial success and personal fulfillment. But here’s the truth: I don’t buy into either philosophy. Not only do I think they’re wrong, but I also believe they distract us from what truly matters. The first type of financial guru focuses on building wealth. These are the Grant Cardone, Gary Vaynerchuk types, the ones who teach you that financial security and success come from earning more, saving aggressively, and investing wisely. Their message is straightforward: Make lots of money, spend less than you earn, and invest prudently—then life will be good. At first glance, this advice makes sense. After all, financial stability is important, and wealth can provide security. But the underlying assumption is flawed: that achieving a certain net worth will bring happiness. Studies, such as the Harvard Study of Adult Development, repeatedly show that money itself is not the key to lasting fulfillment. It’s relationships, purpose, and meaningful engagement with life that truly make us happy. Yet these financial gurus push the idea that accumulating wealth is the ultimate goal. They equate financial success with life success, leading many people to chase numbers in their bank accounts rather than meaningful experiences. The second type of guru takes the opposite approach. Instead of emphasizing earning, they focus on spending—intentionally and unapologetically. Think of Bill Perkins, author of Die With Zero, or Ramit Sethi, who advocates for “living your rich life.” Their core message? Money is meant to be enjoyed, so spend it on experiences, passions, and things that bring you joy. This sounds liberating, but it has its own pitfalls. While it’s true that experiences often bring more happiness than material possessions, the underlying assumption is still problematic. These gurus suggest that the right kind of spending can lead to happiness—just as the first group believes that the right kind of earning can. But here’s the catch: Whether you’re chasing wealth or curating a lifestyle filled with “meaningful” purchases, you’re still operating under the belief that money is the driver of happiness. Both perspectives put too much weight on financial decisions as the primary means to a fulfilling life. Both of these financial philosophies have a fundamental flaw: They assume that money plays a central role in personal fulfillment. But true happiness isn’t about accumulating wealth or spending it in the “right” way—it’s about becoming the person you want to be. If you want to be an author, for example, it’s not about earning enough to quit your job or spending money on expensive writing retreats. It’s about writing. If you want to be an athlete, it’s not about making it to the NBA or buying the best training gear. It’s about playing the game, practicing, and pushing yourself every day. Money can be a useful tool. It can provide security, open doors, and allow you to pursue your passions. But it should never be mistaken for the goal itself. No amount of wealth will define you, just as no amount of spending will complete you. So, if money isn’t the answer, what is? It comes down to action—taking steps toward becoming the person you want to be, regardless of your financial situation. Instead of fixating on making more or spending better, focus on doing. Do the things that align with your values. Engage in activities that bring you purpose. Cultivate relationships that matter. None of these require a certain net worth or a perfectly optimized spending plan. They require something far more valuable: your energy, courage, and commitment. At the end of the day, financial gurus—whether they preach earning or spending—oversimplify the path to happiness. They tell us to chase money, whether to save it or spend it, when in reality, fulfillment comes from something much deeper. So, the real question isn’t, How much money do I need? or What should I spend it on? It’s Do I have the courage to become the person I want to be? Because that’s where true happiness lies.

Reviewed by Lybi Ma Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder is a neurodevelopmental condition where people experience difficulties sustaining attention, sitting still, or controlling their impulses. The condition is serious enough that it significantly decreases life expectancy by an average of eight years. Women with ADHD face additional challenges. A Swedish study on more than 85,000 patients with ADHD showed that women with attention deficit were diagnosed on average four years later than men, even though many had extensively sought help for mental health difficulties. This delay in diagnosis is due to multiple factors. First, diagnostic criteria are inherently biased and do not consider that ADHD may show up differently in women. By 1998, 81 percent of participants across more than 250 studies were male. In the 70 studies that examined cohorts of only 1 sex, 99.7 percent studied males, and 0.3 percent studied females. Those studies laid the foundations for the diagnostic criteria used today to screen for ADHD. If only men, and especially children, were studied, the presentation of ADHD in women will be largely ignored, even though we know today that symptoms may present differently. Women tend to have a more inattentive presentation and internalizing symptoms, which are missed more often during diagnoses and are less often referred. Additionally, women have a higher rate of comorbidities such as anxiety and depression, which makes an ADHD diagnosis even more challenging. But studies also show that doctors are less likely to diagnose women with ADHD even when their symptoms are the same as their male counterparts. Additionally, once a diagnosis is received, women are also less likely to be treated with stimulants and are more likely to be prescribed antidepressants and anxiolytics. Both are less efficient and have more side effects than ADHD medication. One of the main challenges women with ADHD describe when seeking out a diagnosis is that their difficulties are not being addressed. ADHD often comes with comorbid depression and anxiety, and women with ADHD are disproportionately at risk of developing these comorbidities. When seeking out an alternative diagnosis after endless cycles of depression, doctors are quick to dismiss their pleas and simply prescribe antidepressants. In a study that analysed the stories of 52 British women, one of them said that before her diagnosis, she had cycled through 16 different antidepressant medications, all of which were inefficient to address the underlying ADHD. On average, reports in this study also describe that the support received post-diagnosis ranged from insufficient to non-existent, which severely affects quality of life. These experiences are not limited to the National Health Service; women worldwide experience difficulties being heard and treated by medical professionals who often dismiss their struggles and suffering. This is the story of Nelly, who saw psychiatrists and mental health professionals since age 7, was prescribed anxiolytics at age 13, and received an official ADHD diagnosis only at age 28. Like many women, stimulant medication got entirely rid of the recurrent episodes of depression. Another study on 16,000 ADHD patients showed that women with ADHD were more likely to have previously sought help, were more likely to already take antidepressant medication, and had already extensively sought help before their diagnosis compared to men, and then were more likely to discontinue said treatment after starting ADHD medication. Women with ADHD have to deal not only with the classic symptoms of inattention and hyperactivity of ADHD but often have a unique presentation that changes and shifts across the menstrual cycle. They also have more intense difficulties in periods of hormonal transitions like puberty or menopause. Women with ADHD tend to have more hormone-related issues. A study showed that they have higher rates of postpartum depression and that around 49 percent of them also have PMDD. Menopause also appears to exacerbate ADHD symptoms and to increase the risks of depression. But that is not all; a large study showed that women with ADHD taking the contraceptive pill were six times more likely to have depression than women without ADHD. Another study showed that natural hormonal fluctuations during the menstrual cycle altered the intensity and presentation of ADHD symptoms. What Can We Do? Increasing awareness around the unique issues faced by women with ADHD is essential to increase accessibility to diagnosis and treatment. The latest findings in medical curricula could also help medical professionals stay up to date on the diagnostic criteria or symptomatology of common issues. Additionally, doing more research on women and analysing the interactions with hormones may be ideal to create treatments or interventions tailored to these unique challenges. The Welsh study on 16,000 patients with ADHD found that women were more likely to discontinue antidepressant treatment after starting ADHD medication. This shows that the right diagnosis and treatment can be life-changing and have positive effects. While the diagnosis of women with ADHD has significantly increased in recent years, many are still missed. An increase of awareness, acceptance, and medical training can be key to properly supporting all the women who have gone unheard and have silently suffered for many years.
