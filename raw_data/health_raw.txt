March 4, 2025 -- The FDA has approved the first newÂ clot-bustingÂ drug in nearly 30 years, offering a faster way to dissolve blood clots in adults who suffer a stroke.Â The treatment, tenecteplase (sold as TNKase), delivers a single five-second IV shot, making it a faster, easier option. TNKase was initially approved in 2000 to reduce the risk of death from acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), a severe type of heart attack. Stroke is the fifth leading cause of death in the United States and a major cause of disability, affecting over 795,000 people each year. Acute ischemic stroke (AIS) occurs when a blood clot blocks blood flow to the brain, leading to brain damage, disability, or death. Fast treatment is critical to reduce long-term effects and improve recovery.Â TNKase is a lab-made version of a natural protein called tPA, which helps break down blood clots. It sticks to fibrin, the protein that holds clots together, and triggers an enzyme to dissolve them. TNKase is designed to target clots better and last longer than natural tPA. Genentech, part of the Roche group, said in a press release that TNKase can be given quickly,Â unlike Activase (alteplase), which requires an IV injection followed by a 60-minute drip. The FDA approval was based on a large study conducted by the University of Calgary across 22 stroke centers in Canada and funded by the Canadian Institute of Health Research. Findings showed TNKase was as safe and effective as Activase for treating AIS. The most common side effects of TNKase include allergic reactions such as hives and bleeding, particularly in patients with active internal bleeding, recent brain or spinal surgery, a serious head injury, or uncontrolled high blood pressure. Patients or caregivers should inform doctors about any episode of bleeding in the brain or stroke within the past three months and about all their prescription and over-the-counter medications, especially blood thinners as they can further increase bleeding risk. They should also immediately contact their doctor if they notice any unusual bleeding (weird bruises, pink or brown pee, bloody or dark stools, coughing up blood, or throwing up blood that looks like coffee grounds) or signs of a stroke.

TITLE: This Common Vaginal Issue Is Really an STD (Study)

March 6, 2025 â Men whose female sex partners get the itchy vaginal infection called bacterial vaginosis may also start being offered treatment for the condition. Thatâs because a new study has determined that the infection isnât simply a womenâs health issue but is actually a sexually transmitted disease. TheÂ findings, published this week in The New England Journal of Medicine, mark a major shift in how bacterial vaginosis (BV) is understood and defined, challenging long-held views that it was not an STI. BV develops when there is an imbalance in vaginal bacteria, and research now confirms that sexual activityâparticularly with new or multiple partnersâcan introduce or spread the bacteria that cause it. Left untreated, bacterial vaginosis (BV) canÂ increase the risk of getting other STDs, including HIV, and also increases the risk of problems during pregnancy and birth. It is the most common cause of vaginal discharge among women of reproductive age. Until now, there has been no way to prevent the infections. One-third of women worldwide develop BV in their lifetime, and many repeatedly battle the infection, which in addition to itching and discharge can cause a fishy smell and burning during urination. More than half of women with BV experience a recurrence within three months after taking a weeklong course of oral antibiotics, the researchers noted. Experts say the new findings were not surprising. âWeâve suspected for a long time that itâs a sexually transmitted infection (STI) because it has a similar incubation period (after sex) to most STIs and is associated with the same risk factors as STIs like chlamydia, such as change in sexual partner and not using condoms,â said researcher Lenka Vodstrcil, PhD, deputy head of the Genital Microbiota and Mycoplasma Group at Monash Universityâs Melbourne Sexual Health Centre, in aÂ news release. The study included 164 couples in Australia. The women all had BV infections and were in monogamous relationships with male partners. Researchers randomly assigned the couples to follow either traditional treatment (antibiotic for the woman only) or for the woman and the man to take antibiotics, plus for the man to apply a topical antimicrobial cream to the penile skin twice daily for seven days. The research trial was halted early by a research safety oversight panel because it was evident that treating the woman only was inferior to treating both partners. The recurrence rate was 65% among women whose partners werenât treated and 35% among women whose partners were treated. Some treated men did report side effects, including nausea, headache, and metallic taste. âPart of the difficulty in establishing whether BV is sexually transmitted has been that we still donât know precisely which bacteria are the cause but advances in genomic sequencing are helping us close in on that mystery,â said fellow researcher Catriona Bradshaw, PhD. In anÂ editorial published alongside the research results, a pair of infectious disease experts said the evidence that the associated bacteria are transmitted sexually represents a paradigm shift. The findings âalso signify a need for a major change to the treatment approach of women with bacterial vaginosis with respect to how women should be counseled regarding the origin of their infection and to the need to engage their male partners in sharing responsibility for transmission and treatment,â the editorial authors wrote. âTo date, there have been no effective strategies to prevent sexual transmission of bacterial vaginosisâassociated bacteria, apart from consistent use of condoms.â SOURCES: New England Journal of Medicine: âMale-Partner Treatment to Prevent Recurrence of Bacterial Vaginosis,â âBacterial Vaginosis â Time to Treat Male Partners.â Monash University: âNew STI impacts 1 in 3 women: landmark study reveals men are the missing link.â World Health Organization: âBacterial vaginosis.â

March 6, 2025Â â Carolyn Figurelle was in Las Vegas getting ready for her sister-in-lawâs wedding when her 6-month-old sonâs breathing became shallow. Carolyn, in the emergency room in wedding hair and makeup, told her husband to go to the ceremony without her. âI was thinking, âItâs fine, we will be out of here for the reception,ââ she said.Â They stayed for 12 days.Â At the time, fall of 2022, she didnât know much about respiratory syncytial virus â just âanother version of the cold,â she figured â but learned fast in the hospital, surrounded by other RSV-infected babies. During one âterrifyingâ night, her son was rushed to the pediatric intensive care unit with dangerously low oxygen levels. Figurelle also remembers struggling to pump breast milk around the clock so that her son could be fed through a tube, âtiny bits at a time.â âThere were definitely moments during the experience where I thought, âWhat if heâs not coming home?ââ said Figurelle, who lives in Williamsburg, Virginia. The FDA approved aÂ monoclonal antibody to prevent RSV in babies and toddlers in July 2023, followed by the first RSV vaccine for pregnant people inÂ August 2023. Now pregnant with her second, Figurelle made sure to get the RSV vaccine. Her son, almost 3 years old, has received the antibody treatment.Â âPregnancy is the most amazing venue for first vaccination,â saidÂ Natali Aziz, MD, director of pregnancy infectious diseases at Stanford Childrenâs Health and a clinical associate professor of obstetrics & gynecology at Stanford School of Medicine.Â Thatâs because getting vaccinated during pregnancy can protect not just the mom-to-be but also the baby during those first critical months of life. TheÂ American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists advises pregnant people to get flu, Tdap (tetanus, diphtheria, and acellular pertussis), COVID-19, and RSV vaccines. Pregnancy weakens the immune system, raising the risk of serious infections like the flu.Â But uptake has plummeted sinceÂ 2019 and 2020, when 61.2% of pregnant people got the flu vaccine and more than 70% got the COVID vaccine. According to aÂ 2024 CDC survey of pregnant people, 47.7% had a flu vaccine, 30.9% had an updated COVID vaccine, and 59.6% had a Tdap vaccine. As of Feb. 15, 2025, according to the CDCâsÂ weekly tally, 37.5% of pregnant people had a flu vaccination.Â âThese are not optimal numbers,â Aziz said. â[We] should be aiming for 100%.âÂ When a pregnant person gets vaccinated, antibodies travel through the placenta and are passed to the fetus. Antibodies can also transfer to infants through breast milk. Vaccines recommended during pregnancyÂ donât containÂ live virus, so they cause âan immune responseâ in pregnant people, but ânot a true infection,â Aziz said. The baby is then better equipped to fight severe infections.Â COVID vaccination during pregnancy, for example, cuts hospitalization riskÂ by 52% among infants under 6 months. Maternal influenza vaccination isÂ 91.5% effective in preventing hospitalization of infants for flu during their first six months.Â âSometimes babies start with a viral infection, like influenza, and then get a bacterial infection on top of [that],â saidÂ Cynthia Rand, MD, MPH, professor of pediatrics and division chief of general pediatrics at the University of Rochester Medical Center.Â Pertussis, also known as whooping cough, is a growing concern among pediatricians like Rand. Cases have been on the rise following a pandemic-era dip,Â according to the CDC. There were six times as many reported cases in December 2024 as in 2023, representing an increase from pre-pandemic rates in 2019. Most cases and deaths are amongÂ infants ages 3 months and younger.Â âWhatâs really scary is they just stop breathing,â Rand said.Â Infants canât get vaccinated against pertussis until theyâreÂ about 8 weeks old, so maternal Tdap vaccination is crucial. It protects infantsÂ younger than 2 months from getting sick with pertussis, and protectsÂ 9 in 10 infants against pertussis hospitalization. Depending on the timing of their pregnancy, pregnant people can either get the RSV vaccine or their baby can get the monoclonal antibody nirsevimab (Beyfortus). Nirsevimab protects against RSV for at least five months, and in aÂ phase III clinical trial reduced RSV infections needing medical care and hospitalizations among healthy full- and near-full term infants by about 76%.Â Â The antibody treatment âis dramatically changing the landscape of RSV infection,â Rand said. âHowever, a lot of parents havenât vaccinated their child or vaccinated themselves [for RSV], and that is a shame.âÂ Rand pointed out that RSV vaccine uptake among pregnant people has been strong, especially considering how new it is. As of January 2025, 60.6% of infants born since April 1, 2024, were reportedly protected against RSV, with 14% protected through maternal immunization and 46.6% having received nirsevimab,Â according to the CDC.Â There are lower rates of vaccination inÂ Black and Latino populations, as well as amongÂ uninsured pregnant people.Â Vaccine skepticism is also on the rise.Â Among pregnant people, flu vaccine hesitancy increased from 17% to 25% while Tdap vaccine hesitancy grew from 15% to 20% in 2023 to 2024, compared to 2022 to 2023.Â âUnfortunately, there is more vaccine hesitancy than there was in my practice five to eight years ago,â Rand said. âThatâs nerve-racking to me.âÂ Randâs forthcoming research shows that flu vaccination rates improved when providers strongly recommended the vaccine. Tdap rates also improved when providers repeatedly offered vaccination, discussed the effect on newborns, and stocked the vaccine in their office.Â Still, obstetricians and pediatricians are pressed for time, many online sources are rife with misinformation, and simplyÂ debunking vaccine myths doesnât work.Â âWeâre not all drawing from the same well of the same facts,â said Karen Ernst, program director forÂ Voices for Vaccines, an advocacy and education organization. âWith someone with hesitancy, we shouldnât close out the conversation. After you give them information, you ask, âWhat are your thoughts now?ââ Ernst said.Â For her part, Figurelle has been speaking out on social media. Sheâs often one of the first to comment when pregnant people seek opinions on specific vaccines, sometimes sharing âa condensed versionâ of what happened to her family.Â âI basically say I would rather do everything I can to prevent that,â she said. âI donât know if that changes anyoneâs mind.âÂ SOURCES: Carolyn Figurelle, Â Williamsburg, VA.Â Natali Aziz, MD, director of pregnancy infectious diseases, Stanford Childrenâs Health; clinical associate professor of obstetrics & gynecology, Stanford School of Medicine.

Feb. 28, 2025 â If youâre like many Americans, you probably have a fitness tracker or a smartwatch on your wrist or finger. As of 2023, a little more than a third of the population uses wearable trackers. They flood us with data, hours and quality of sleep, resting heart rate, exercise heart rate, calorie expenditure, time spent standing, step count, step length, step asymmetry, how fast you do stairs, and more.Â All that data can be overwhelming â sometimes even stressful and counterproductive. Which stats really matter? âIt can be hard to process all the information streaming in from our watches,â said David Conroy, PhD, professor of applied exercise science at the University of Michigan and a researcher of physical activity tracking. âIn our work, weâve narrowed in on step count as the important metric.â Unless youâre working toward a specific health or fitness goal, step count indeed stands out among all the others for general wellness and longevity, as more and more research shows. The largest study â a collaborative effort by Johns Hopkins University, the University of Minnesota, and the University of Colorado â combed numbers in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). The researchers compared 15 markers that impact longevity, and movement stood above all other measurements. This included predictors like age, gender, race, lifestyle habits, and more. âActivity is an easily modifiable measure, and some of the others are not,â said Erjia Cui, PhD, an assistant professor at the University of Minnesota and one of the studyâs co-authors.Â The main takeaway: In a world of overwhelming data availability, the simple act of moving more each day will make the biggest difference in your longevity. With all those handy measurements, why should movement be the one you care most about? âItâs very easy to understand,â said Conroy. âIt represents your volume of activity, whether by running or walking, or some combination of the two.âÂ If youâre a swimmer or cyclist, or you use a wheelchair, step count isnât going to give you the best measurement, said Conroy. But for most folks, movement on feet is the easiest, most quantitative factor to track. âThe caveat is that these devices have created a trap,â he said. âPeople want an easy answer â am I moving enough?â That is a more difficult question to answer. For decades, the goal was 10,000 steps a day â but further research has shown that step counts as low as 2,500 still deliver long-term health benefits that increase as your step count rises â even past 10,000. The bottom line, however, is that more movement is better for you and serves as the best measurement of longevity.Â From where Cui stands, you should make it your goal to achieve as much movement as possible in any given day â and any is better than none. âWe know that the step count measurements on tracking devices are generally accurate, so pay attention to those,â he said. Lack of a tracker is no problem, said Conroy, as long as youâre moving and you have a general idea of time and distance. âIt could be that keeping a journal about your activity produces just as good a measurement.âÂ Why? When you manually track your movement, you put thought and reflection into it. This process allows you to think about how you moved, how long, and where, which gives you the opportunity to reflect on whatâs working and whatâs not.Â For example: if you track a daily walk in your journal, you might notice that it typically falls during your lunch hour. That can give you incentive to prioritize that time for exercise. âA wearable canât do that,â said Conroy. âYouâre actively thinking about your activity, retrieving it from memory, and that forces you to reflect on it.âÂ Everyone is different, of course, and how you measure your activity isnât as important as doing it. But, Conroy said, devices cost money and arenât accessible to everyone. âWeâve developed a bit of mystique around the trackers,â he said, âand that might be overstated.â What matters is knowing yourself and what helps motivate you to move. âKnow that the trackers arenât a silver bullet,â he said. âYou can get just as much bang for your buck from tracking activity on your own.âÂ Ashley Mateo, a 39-year-old freelance writer and running coach, collects and measures a bevy of statistics from both a smartwatch and a ring. âI originally started tracking on an early version Apple watch,â she said. âI wanted to âclose my rings,â hit my calorie goals, and know how much I was moving, If I was doing all the things right, I felt I was healthy.âÂ The key for Mateo is she has fitness goals more specific than simply looking out for her general health. As a competitive runner, Mateo now crunches certain metrics to enhance her training. In particular, she likes to know her heart rate variability, her resting heart rate, and her sleep patterns. âI donât rely on the data alone, but if Iâm feeling off, I can check my numbers and see if they indicate thereâs a reason for that.â If the data and how she feels align and indicate she might be getting sick or that she needs more rest and recovery, Mateo might then dial back her run plans for the day. âI follow my body first, and if the watch also tells me I didnât sleep well and should take it easy, then I probably will,â she explained. âThe data has to correlate to how Iâm feeling before I take action.âÂ She also watches her overall activity and allows her watch to serve as a nudge to move more throughout her day. âIâve noticed that when Iâm moving more than just during my workouts, I feel better,â Mateo said. âIâm in a better mood and have more energy.âÂ While Mateoâs goals with her devices are different than the general population seeking health and longevity, they demonstrate how the various data can serve people in a variety of ways. âIt really comes down to different strokes for different folks,â said Conroy. âEveryone has their preferences, whether in the type of exercise you choose or how you track movement.âÂ But if youâre not a competitive athlete and longevity is the goal, you can simplify your life by focusing on the simple data point of movement.Â âIf we had a drug that could positively impact as many different systems in the body as movement, it would be a blockbuster,â said Conroy. âBut thereâs no pill that can increase longevity, reduce depression and anxiety, improve your bone health, or any other factor as much as exercise.âÂ SOURCES: David Conroy, PhD, professor of applied exercise science, University of Michigan.
