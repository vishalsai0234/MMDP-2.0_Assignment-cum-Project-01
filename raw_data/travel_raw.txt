TITLE: China’s other great wall is impressive, too—and steeped in history
DATE: 
CONTENT:
The 8.5-mile-long wall that surrounds Xi’an, touted as one of the best-preserved walled fortifications in China, could be the next UNESCO World Heritage site. It’s the weekend of the mid-autumn festival in Xi’an, and all roads seem to lead to the south gate of the city's wall. In China’s central province of Shaanxi, Xi’an is primarily known for the museum that houses the army of terra-cotta warriors commissioned by China’s first ruler to protect him in his afterlife. But the wall, on this Saturday evening, is where all the action is. Families are taking an evening stroll, complete with laughing, screaming children. There are vendors and buskers, tourists on bicycles, food stalls, and souvenir shops. Couples wearing regal red robes are wilting under the strobe lights for bridal photoshoots. Meanwhile, other photographers are capturing dozens of young women dressed up in flowy hanfu – traditional costumes from the Tang era that are suddenly in vogue among China’s youth. Dozens of ornate watchtowers, turrets, parapets, and pavilions are scattered along the length of the wall. As dusk falls and the red lanterns and lights come on, the whole scene assumes a fairytale vibe. When people mention 'wall' in the context of China, it is generally assumed to refer to the mammoth structure known as the Great Wall of China. But there are dozens, if not hundreds, of city walls throughout the country, in Beijing, Nanjing, Fenghuang, Pingyao, and Xi’an, among others. “The word for city in China, cheng / 城 means walled city,” says Kenneth Swope, professor of history at the University of Southern Mississippi and expert on imperial Chinese military history. Yinong Cheng, professor at the School of History and Archival Studies at Yunnan University, adds that city walls tended to perform three main functions: defense, flood protection, and show of imperial might. Several of these city walls, dating back to the Ming and Qing Dynasties, are now on UNESCO’s tentative list of heritage sites. The Xi’an wall—originally built during the Tang era (618 – 907 C.E.) and later expanded by the Ming dynasty from 1370 onwards—is considered the most complete and well-preserved. The wall runs for 8.5 miles (13.7 km) and measures 40 feet (12 meters) in height and 49 feet (15 meters) in width. Four main gates face each cardinal direction, and there are 14 minor gates in between, and a moat surrounds it. Swope also says that the more powerful the rulers, the higher and more impressive the walls. This certainly makes sense for Xi’an (formerly Chang’an), an important city through early imperial times, serving as capital for the Han, Sui, and Tang dynasties. Xi’an is also the starting point of the network of trading routes known as the Silk Road. It was a planned city, built as a perfect grid with the wall enclosing it in a complete, rectangular loop. Even today, for some, it is possible to walk the entire length of the wall without a break. “It was always a significant post not only for commercial transactions but also diplomatic transactions. There is no doubt that Chang'an was already walled in early imperial times, say, by the third-second century B.C.E.,” says Hilde De Weerdt, a professor of Chinese and Modern Global History at KU Leuven in Belgium. “So, when we say this is a 14th century wall, it is the earliest moment that we know of any (significant) renovation.” The reason for the wall’s grandeur stems from Chang’an’s strategic importance combined with the Ming dynasty’s need to project their stately authority through such structures. “I can't actually think of a foreign invasion that would have warranted this (wall), because it's not even near any major border,” says Dr Lars Laamann, Assistant Professor of History at SOAS University of London. According to Swope, the Ming era was the pinnacle of “imperial architecture,” which gave us landmarks like the Forbidden City and the Temple of Heaven in Beijing. Coming right after the nomadic Mongols, the Ming rulers saw these walls as a way to rebuild Chinese pride. The original purpose of these walls may have been to contain the cities or the populace within the perimeter. But over time, the towns grew beyond these boundaries, turning these walls into midtown anachronisms. From the top of the Xi’an wall, the sights and sounds of modern life are inescapable—skyscrapers and neon lights, honking cars and scurrying pedestrians. After the terra-cotta army, the wall is now one of Xi’an’s most popular tourist attractions. It has welcomed hundreds of famous visitors, including Bill Clinton, Michelle Obama, and Mark Zuckerberg, who went for a rain-soaked run on the wall's walkway. The Xi’an wall faced the threat of demolition during the 1950s as part of the country’s Great Leap Forward narrative. Cheng says that even though widespread demolition started even earlier, towards the end of the Qing era (circa 1912), the wall stayed mostly intact, thanks to Xi’an’s status as an ancient historic capital. The real challenge came later. “The story of conservation takes us from the Ming era to Mao Zedong,” says Dr Laamann, referring to the renowned architectural historian couple Lin Huiyin and Liang Sicheng. “It was a power struggle within the Communist Party, when one faction wanted to get rid of old medieval structures in the country, because they thought in the modern world, there was no place for such remnants of the past.” Lin and Liang fought to preserve the city walls everywhere—they lost in Beijing but won in Xi’an. De Weerdt points out that the struggle between conservation and modernization is universal, citing the example of medieval walls in France and Italy torn down in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. “A lot of what we see in the Xi’an wall today is rebuilt with modern materials and modern ways of thinking,” she explains. However, this version of the wall integrates the cultural angle with the social: locals and tourists alike get to appreciate the city’s heritage while also using it as an urban public space. Xi’an is connected to all major cities in China, so travelers can get there by plane and high-speed train. You can also fly directly into Xi’an’s Xianyang International Airport from a few cities in Asia, such as Hong Kong, Seoul, Kuala Lumpur, and Beijing. When you arrive in Xi’an, you can navigate the city easily on foot or by metro.

TITLE: 10 family-friendly things to do in Texas
DATE: 
CONTENT:
Feel tiny under the big Texas sky, marvel at an annual bat migration, travel on horseback through a colorful canyon, and soak in sublime hot springs. Larger than any country in Western Europe, Texas sprawls across more than 268,000 square miles that touch Mexico, the Gulf of Mexico, and four U.S. states. The Lone Star State is so vast and diverse in its landscapes and cultures that it can feel like a wondrous country all its own. Wherever you land to kick off your family adventures here—whether an urban metropolis like Dallas-Fort Worth, Houston, or Austin, or somewhere altogether more off the grid—you can expect a surprise and inspiration at every turn. Travel to Texas for desert landscapes covered in cacti, canyons striated with color, long stretches of golden beachfront, and freshwater springs that run gin-clear.  Mexican and Hispanic culture influence art, music, and cuisine, and the state’s iconic cowboy culture, small-town hospitality, and international voices from around the globe are woven through the Texan fabric. Here are some of the best family adventures to consider when planning a multi-generational vacation in Texas. (Related: 10 best things to do in Texas.) Your backyard telescope can't compare to seeing the heavens from this astronomical research center in the Davis Mountains of West Texas. The McDonald Observatory is affiliated with the University of Texas at Austin and is open to the public several days a week for visits. On clear days, you can see live views of sunspots and flares on the sun's surface through a solar telescope in a theater setting and go on a guided tour of the research telescopes. Evening Star Party programs take place three nights a week (Tuesday, Friday, and Saturday) and come with the chance to peer at distant galaxies and planets through cutting-edge telescopes within the on-site Rebecca Gale Telescope Park. You and your family may never look at the night sky quite the same again. There are backyard treasure hunts—and then there are ones where the items you and the kids are searching for date back many millions of years. Drive about 92 miles north of Dallas to Ladonia Fossil Park, where visitors will find a wooly mammoth, shark bones, and ancient ammonites from the Cretaceous Period (between 145 and 65 million years ago). Park your car and follow a short path to access this area that was once part of the Western Interior Seaway, where spear tips and arrowheads used by the local Caddo Indians are often unearthed. After a heavy rain, visitors can sift through the gravel and mud for newly revealed fossils, exposed by erosion. Consider bringing a screwdriver to help loosen anything from the muck and shale. There’s no entry fee, and you can take anything you find with you as long as it isn’t deemed to have scientific importance. Just 25 miles south of Amarillo, families can go horseback riding through Palo Duro Canyon State Park to witness 230 million years of geological layers. From March through November, Old West Stables, inside the park, leads groups out for hour-long tours into the rugged canyon. Tell the kids to keep their eye peeled for interesting fauna like wild turkeys, road runners, and non-native North African aoudad sheep (introduced here in the 1950s). The Rio Grande River forms the southern boundary of Big Bend National Park from Mariscal Canyon to the Terrell-Val Verde Country line (on the U.S. side). You’re in a stunning stretch of far west Texas here, home to picturesque landscapes where the river cuts through towering limestone canyons and the views stretch into Mexico. Get an amazing view of the Rio Grande River from on high when you take the family for a hike along the cliff tops of the easy, mile-long Hot Springs Historic Trail loop. Bring your bathing suits for a group soak in the park’s Hot Springs Historic District, where you can bask in the balmy waters that bubble up at 105°F (40°C) in the remains of a historic bathhouse’s foundations, located on the north banks of the Rio Grande River. (Related: Visiting Texas? Here's what the locals love.) American paleontologist Roland T. Bird discovered the world’s first sauropod tracks in 1938—an hour’s drive (roughly 60 miles) southwest of Fort Worth. The small-headed dinosaur with a very long neck was just one of the Cretaceous-period animals that once roamed the shallow seabed at the site of present-day Dinosaur Valley State Park. Your kids’ feet will be particularly dwarfed by some of the best-preserved dinosaur tracks found here, including those of theropods and Sauroposeidon proteles—Texas’s official state dinosaur that towered up to 23 feet high. Because the tracks are located on the riverbed, water sometimes obscures them. Check the park’s website before visiting for regular updates regarding which trails are open and if the tracks are visible. For beginners who’ve dreamed of hanging ten, you should consider letting a man and his best friend (the “surf dog,” Astro) show you the ropes along Texas’ Gulf Coast at the South Padre Surf Company. Get into the water with the family for lessons with experienced waterman and former Hawaiian lifeguard Gene Gore, who teaches year-round at Isla Blanca Beach, located on the southernmost tip of the island near the South Padre Jetties. Soft surfboards are also for rent for those who wish to paddle out on their own. But the chance to get private instruction from the wave-riding pup and Gore—a surfboard designer who grew up riding waves on the beaches of Texas—makes for a particularly memorable session. Not all shows in the sky are celestial. Mexican free-tailed bats emerge en masse for a spectacle every evening from May to September at Bracken Cave Preserve on private land in the Texas Hill Country about 30 miles northeast of San Antonio. The cave houses the largest bat colony in the world, with some 15 million bats making it their summertime mating address. Baby bats are born inside Bracken Cave in June, with July and August considered the best months for seeing them emerge to put their wings to the test, hunting things like corn earworm moths. Reservations must be made in advance to visit, and you should plan to spend three hours on-site during the guided tours while waiting for the bats. The beginning of May to the end of August is the best time to escape the Texas heat with a float along the crystal-clear waters of the San Marcos River (south of Austin), where the state’s best tube run awaits. The water bubbles up from some 200 artesian springs in nearby Spring Lake and stays a relatively brisk 72°F (22°C) year-round. And it’s so clear that you can often spot sunfish and red-eared sliders passing beneath you. It takes about an hour to float down the river along its most popular public access route for tubing (hop in City Park and exit the water at Rio Vista Park). Rent tubes from the San Marcos Lions Club Tube Rental and other local outfitters that provide a shuttle service that brings you back to the put-in point. For an otherworldly experience, head to East Texas within the cypress-lined and swampy wilderness of Caddo Lake. The 25,000-acre wetland wonderland straddles the border of the Lone Star State and neighboring Louisiana, about 170 miles east of Dallas, a 2.5-hour drive. A labyrinth of slow-moving bayous is the habitat for 70 species of fish (largemouth bass, bluegill, catfish, and more), armadillos, white-tail deer, and one of the largest populations of alligators in Texas. Families should explore the terrain via pontoon boat swamp tours with Captain Ron’s Swamp Tours. Until the 19th century, the area was home to the Caddo Indians. The 90-minute cruises take up to nine people to journey deep into the wetlands to explore the history with informative and entertaining commentary from your captain. The Galveston Historical Foundation leads Historic Harbor Tour and Dolphin Watch cruises into Galveston Bay aboard the sightseeing vessel Seagull II to look for common bottlenose dolphins. It’s the only species of cetacean native to the bays and estuaries of Texas. When conditions are calm, the boat’s top deck is the perfect perch for scouting for marine mammals and myriad seabirds during hour-long cruises. Tours leave from the Galveston Historic Seaport, where you can catch sight (and even tour and play pirate) of the 1877 tall ship Elissa, a square-rigged iron barque brought here from Greece for restoration. Texas—the second largest state in the U.S.—sprawls across more than 268,000 square miles, connected by highways and backroads, particularly in and around the major metropolitan areas. Your best bet for seeing its vibrant cities and the hinterlands is to rent a car and set off on the ultimate Texas road trip. Hyatt Regency Lost Pines Resort & Spa: Outside of Austin, this family resort on 405 acres along the Lower Colorado River offers guided stargazing and kayaking trips and has an on-site waterpark, lazy river, and resident alpacas. Cibolo Creek Ranch: Settle in for a luxury ranch stay at this 33-room property on 30,000 acres in West Texas. Enjoy family activities like mountain biking excursions along abandoned mining trails in the Big Bend region, horseback riding, and open-air Humvee tours The Trueheart Hotel: This Hill Country boutique hotel with just 13 rooms, suites, and cottages in the German-inflected town of Fredericksburg (80 miles west of Austin and 70 miles north of San Antonio) has a creekside covered patio and a fire pit to gather around once your day’s adventures are done. The Woodlands Resort, Curio Collection by Hilton: Just north of Houston on Lake Harrison, here’s another sprawling family resort with heated pools, a lazy river, a 30-foot water slide, tennis courts, and 200 miles of hiking and biking trails.

TITLE: 10 family-friendly hotels in Texas, from El Paso to Galveston
DATE: 
CONTENT:
Looking for a hotel that keeps both adults and kids in mind? These options across the state offer on-site water parks and bike trails, or easy access to nearby river cruises and dinosaur tracks. Interactive museums and street art. Hiking and horseback riding. Dinosaur tracks and early settlements. These Texas hotels give adults and kids easy access to all the state has to offer. And with on-site pools, tennis courts, and even TopGolf simulators, it’s more than okay to just hang out on the property, too. Overlooking the famous River Walk, the 338-room, Spanish Colonial-style Omni La Mansión del Rio (which dates to 1852 itself) boasts an enviable perch in the heart of it all. From cooking classes to scavenger hunts to a courtyard pool, there’s plenty for kids to do right on-site. Alternatively, hop on a 35-minute narrated river cruise showcasing the city’s architecture and blend of cultures, or tour the Alamo, a Spanish mission where a key battle of the Texan Revolution was fought. (“Remember the Alamo” would go on to be a rallying cry during the Mexican-American War.) Good to Know: A children’s museum with maker space, a bubble lab, and an outdoor play area, San Antonio’s DoSeum is consistently ranked among the top attractions for kids. An opulent 1925 estate with stained glass windows and a stone fireplace, The Rosewood Mansion on Turtle Creek is the ideal base from which to explore these sister cities’ top museums. Among them are the Perot Museum of Nature and Science; The Sixth Floor Museum at Dealey Plaza (best for older children and teens as it chronicles the assassination and contributions of President John F. Kennedy); and multiple museums dedicated to aviation. After a day out and about, return to the hotel’s impeccable service and comforts, which means families are well taken care of—think cribs, baby monitors, bottle warmers, pint-sized robes, slippers, toys, and sweet treats. Good to Know: Dallas’s Klyde Warren Park, a 5.2-acre green space with a playground, interactive fountains, and food trucks selling everything from donuts to pizza, is a great spot for families. In western Texas, named for the Rio Grande’s dramatic curve in flow, Big Bend National Park is synonymous with starry skies, limestone canyons, and desert wildlife. Families will love the easy hikes, ranger-led programs, and fossil discovery area. As for where to stay, consider the Old West-themed Lajitas Golf Resort, nestled among the mountains. The sprawling property offers a variety of room configurations, including two-bedroom suites in the remodeled La Cuesta building (next to the pool!) as well as standalone haciendas and cottages. Good to Know: The property maintains its own stables and equestrian center, so be sure to book a family horseback riding experience. (Related: 10 best things to do in Texas.) If you have plans to visit Galveston, then consider staying at  Moody Gardens. A veritable playground for young and old, the complex features an aquarium, rainforest, and discovery museum (each housed within its own striking pyramid-shaped building), as well as a golf course and 428-room hotel.  Beat the heat during the summer months, when Moody Gardens operates a manmade beach-cum-water park with a wave pool, lazy river, tower slides, and a splashpad. Remarkably, Moody Gardens is a non-profit as part of the education-focused Moody Foundation. Good to Know: Galveston Island is connected to the mainland by a bridge, though free ferry transport is also an option. In Texas Hill Country, off Fredericksburg’s Main Street, the new 105-room Albert Hotel feels inviting and cozy, seamlessly combining historic buildings with new construction just behind them. Families will appreciate the bunk bed-configured rooms, sunken limestone pool, and on-site artisanal market and deli, not to mention proximity to attractions such as the Pioneer Museum, where costumed docents take visitors back in time to the town’s early days as a German settlement. Good to Know: Several nearby nature spaces, including Enchanted Rock State Natural Area and Lady Bird Johnson Municipal Park, are great for short walks, getting out, and picnicking. Upon arriving at this 490-room ranch-style resort on the outskirts of Austin, visitors will quickly realize why guests rarely leave the property. The Hyatt Regency Lost Pines Resort & Spa has an on-site water park; a corral with longhorns, horses, and pigs; biking trails; and archery and tennis to keep kids active and parents happy. Opt for one of the 450-square-foot double queen rooms with patio access or an 860-square-foot family suite with a dining area and sleeper sofa. Good to know: For those ready to step off-property, the McKinney Roughs Nature Park, with ziplining and UTV rides, is just minutes away. A boutique property in sleepy Glen Rose, an hour from the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex, La Palmilla features bright, whitewashed rooms with terracotta tiles and colorful textiles. For families, the property’s two and three-bedroom casitas are a great fit with living and dining areas as well as full kitchens. Nearby, Dinosaur Valley State Park is the town’s star attraction, with preserved dinosaur footprints (from the Cretaceous Age some 13 million years ago when central Texas was covered by a shallow sea) visible in the riverbed. Canoeing and fishing in the river are also permitted. Good to Know: Keep the prehistoric theme going at Dinosaur World, an outdoor park with some 150 life-size dinosaur replicas spread across 20 acres. (Related: Visiting Texas? Here's what the locals love.) Movie stars to former Presidents have stayed at the Hotel Paso Del Norte, originally opened in 1912. Stand in awe within the historic lobby topped with a blue-green stained-glass dome and walls made from gypsum from nearby White Sands. Request a room facing the Franklin Mountains. From hiking to the farmers market, El Paso has lots to offer, though families will want to hit nearby White Sand National Park, where kids can sled down powdery, soft dunes. Good to Know: El Paso boasts a vibrant art scene with several museums as well as dozens of murals celebrating Chicano heritage. Consider a walking tour through the Lincoln Park and El Segundo Barrio districts to catch some of the colorful street art. Spot quail, roadrunners, rabbits, and even coyotes from one of Doves Rest Cabins’ 20 accommodations, all just three miles from the Palo Duro Canyon entrance. The cliffside SkyHouse cabin is notable for its spectacular views of the canyon floor, especially at sunrise and sunset, but also for its vaulted ceilings, stone fireplace, and terrace patio, not to mention its full kitchen and grill. Good to Know: The second-largest canyon system in the U.S., Palo Duro measures approximately 120 miles long and 20 miles wide. From hiking to horseback riding to birdwatching, there’s plenty for families to do. A favorite among families for its attention to detail and service, the 404-room Four Seasons Hotel Houston, housed within a sleek downtown high-rise, recently unveiled a multi-million-dollar renovation, outfitting rooms and public spaces with custom-made furniture by Houston-based designer Eric Brand, as well as plenty of leather and brass accents. Along with the pool and children’s amenities, the property’s two Topgolf game simulator areas on the first floor are very popular with junior golfers. Good to Know: Bookmark a day to spend at NASA’s Johnson Space Center, just beyond the city limits, to tour the mission control (used during the Apollo missions) and an astronaut training facility.

To get the best value, helpful booking tips and language lowdown, try this handy guide. Central America is home to undisputed wonders. Its cultural attractions span ancient Maya sites, colourful 16th-century cities and Indigenous markets, while its landscapes cover active volcanoes, Caribbean beaches and tracts of jungle that are home to unique birds and big cats. Yet, for the most part, it's remained out of the international tourist trail, which means planning a first-time trip here can be somewhat intimidating. The short answer is no. Without a visa, you can visit Belize for up to 30 days; Costa Rica for up to 180; and Panama for up to three months (if you arrive by land or air). Under the Central America Border Control Agreement, you can travel to and between El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua for up to 90 days without a visa — or having to undergo border checks when crossing between countries by land. Independent travel is generally safe and relatively easy. With a phone, it's straightforward to book tickets and discover timetables for a network of buses, private minibuses, cross-border shuttles and water taxis; a growing number of domestic and interregional flights cover longer distances. Self-drive is an option in the Yucatán Peninsula, Costa Rica, Nicaragua and Panama. Here, petrol stations and highway restaurants, cafes and food stalls are found everywhere. Elsewhere, road infrastructure can be lacking; safety is a concern in Honduras and areas of El Salvador and Guatemala. Each country has a different security situation. As long as you heed official FCDO advice when deciding where to visit, the recommended safety precautions apply to many countries outside the region, too. Don’t wear valuables, be mindful while displaying phones and cameras, and only carry the cash you need, ideally in a money belt (try not to alert people to its presence). Withdraw it inside banks and shopping malls. Belize is an English-speaking country. In the rest of the region, locals working in the tourist industry in major cities and travel hot spots speak English. Away from these areas, you may find it difficult to be understood, so consider downloading translation apps and learning a few basic phrases. Central Americans speak Spanish at a moderate pace and enunciate clearly; if you learnt a Romance language, you’re halfway there in communication know-how. The reality is that women are likely to be approached and hassled, but travelling here is just as safe as it is in many other countries — and as a backpacking destination, it’s easy to meet other travellers en route. It’s wise not to engage men in conversation and consider wearing a fake wedding ring to ward off unwanted attention. As in other destinations, women should avoid walking alone at night in larger cities or along beaches; travelling at night should be avoided, regardless of gender. From wildlife-spotting excursions to jungle adventures, there’s plenty to keep all ages entertained. Children are active participants in all aspects of everyday life in Mexico, doted on and treated with a high level of respect. Some longer journeys could prove challenging, particularly those over uneven mountain roads.

TITLE: The unexpected wine country you need to visit: New Mexico
DATE: 
CONTENT:
Hispanic and Native American wine producers cultivate vineyards at high altitude and on desert plains in this southwestern state, making for some unique cellar-door visits. Framed by the Sangre de Cristo Mountains in the north and the Chihuahuan Desert in the south, the US’s fifth-largest state is a land of rolling sand dunes, prehistoric petroglyphs, fairytale caves and dormant volcanoes. Equally as diverse as the topography is the culture, which reflects the history of the Indigenous, Hispanics and Anglo Americans who have coexisted in New Mexico for centuries. You’re most likely to first encounter this diversity through the cuisine — a bright and colourful melange of Native American, Mexican and Spanish flavours makes it one of the state’s biggest draws. But with fiery green chilli stew and billowing, fluffy frybread demanding attention, the story of one item at the table is easily overlooked: wine. Long before Californians planted their first vineyards, New Mexico was growing grapes. A Native American pueblo just south of Albuquerque was the first recorded site of a vineyard in the state, established by two Franciscan monks in 1629. By 1880, more than 3,000 acres of vineyards were producing 908,000 gallons of wine, making New Mexico the fifth-largest wine producer in the country. Over the next century, New Mexico’s wine production declined due to a series of devastating floods, coupled with the rise of competitors like California. Wineries began resurfacing in the 1970s and by the new millennium, New Mexico was producing nearly one million gallons of wine. The industry has continued to grow ever since — yet it remains little known among international wine-lovers. That’s partly because very few of New Mexico’s 56 wineries export overseas. Around 85% are small businesses, producing fewer than 7,000 cases a year. This makes tasting New Mexico’s wines an experience worth travelling for. Winemakers here take pride in the personal touch they bring to cellar door experiences, even as the industry continues to grow — informal conversations around a glass of wine make tasting sessions feel like you’re being hosted in someone’s home. Community spirit among the winemakers is strong, too, thanks to the challenges of working in such remote, rugged environments. (Love discovering unexpected wine regions? Meet Turkey’s Çal.) Today, you’ll find wineries across the state’s vast range of ecosystems. The most prolific area is between Albuquerque and the Texas border, where the southern grape-growing regions of the Middle Rio Grande Valley and Mimbres Valley are home to 85% of the state’s wineries. Here, warm days and cool nights create ideal conditions for growing Italian varietals like Sangiovese and Montepulciano. The easiest place to try New Mexico’s wines is the state capital of Albuquerque, with its high concentration of tasting rooms around the Old Town Plaza and access to picturesque vineyards within an hour’s drive of the city. One of the most interesting winemaking regions is set around the town of Taos in the north, where travellers get to see first-hand the adventurous spirit of New Mexico’s winemakers growing grapes — such as Merlot and Riesling — at high altitude. Inhabited by Native Americans since 1450, Taos is today a hub for alpine sports enthusiasts and spiritual wellness seekers — but it’s also the ideal place for tasting the full-bodied, complex wines of New Mexico’s northernmost wine region. On the way there from Albuquerque, you’ll pass prehistoric adobe buildings, Native American pueblos and old Spanish settlements where wine grapes have been grown for centuries. As you climb from the desert to the mountains and notice the temperature drop, it’s not hard to imagine the obstacles wineries face at 7,000ft — frost kill, a shorter growing season and hail, to name just a few. “Since New Mexico’s demographics are already diverse, the industry is diverse,” says Chris Goblet, executive director of New Mexico Wine, a nonprofit company working to promote and protect the state’s wine. New Mexico has one of the highest percentages of Hispanics in the US — 49.78% in 2024, according to the World Population Review — and travellers can see this reflected in the cellar door experience at local vineyards, where they can taste wines crafted by Native American, female and Hispanic winemakers. You can savour Spanish slow-roasted pig at the rustic cellar door of Las Nueve Niñas Winery in the Sangre de Cristo Mountains, or sip wine while watching a flamenco performance in one of Vara Winery’s three contemporary tasting rooms — two in Albuquerque and one in Santa Fe. Elsewhere, while gazing out at the jagged peaks of Barrancos Blancos mountain from Vivác Winery in Dixon, visitors can taste the smooth, berry-forward chokecherry wine, made in partnership with Robert Mirabal, a Grammy Award-winning Native American musician.

TITLE: It's the 100th anniversary of The Great Gatsby and New York is ready to party, old sport
DATE: 
CONTENT:
A hundred years after The Great Gatsby shone a light on extravagant Long Island mansions and secret speakeasies, the spirit of the Roaring Twenties is returning to New York. It’s late morning in Harlem and the jazz brunch at Minton’s Playhouse is in full swing. Cocktails are flying out across the polished mirrored bar, as up on stage a spotlit singer croons over an Ella Fitzgerald number. Behind her are framed photos of the jazz greats who once jammed at this legendary nightclub, including Billie Holiday and Dizzy Gillespie. To glance around the low-lit room, filled with chatter and jive, feels like stepping into New York’s storied past — back to a time when speakeasies were jumping with live music, and bobbed hair and bow ties were the uniform of choice. I’ve come to Minton’s Playhouse to meet with Michael Arenella, a musician and bandleader who’s reinterpreted New York’s Jazz Age for a new generation. It’s a period closely associated with The Great Gatsby, F Scott Fitzgerald’s cult-classic novel from 1925, which turns 100 this year. Set in New York state, and waltzing between the clandestine rumble of the city and the plush opulence of Long Island, the story charts the rise and fall of the mysteriously wealthy Jay Gatsby. Taking place during Prohibition, the period between 1920 and 1933 when the sale of alcohol in the US was illegal, the novel pulls back the velvet curtain on the stylish soirees and drunken extravagances that carried on regardless, to a spiffy score of jazz music. (During Prohibition, Harlem night clubs kept the party going.) With his hair artfully sculpted into a slick side parting, a neatly pressed handkerchief poking from his breast pocket and cream linen trousers that wouldn’t look out of place in Jay Gatsby’s wardrobe, Michael appears every inch the dapper gentleman. He requested that we meet at this Manhattan jazz institution because it holds a special place in his heart, Michael tells me when he arrives. “This place is really the last link to the Harlem Renaissance,” he says, in reference to the era spanning the 1920s and 1930s when African American literature, fashion and music — particularly jazz — flourished in the city. Having been shuttered for decades, in 2006 Minton’s Playhouse reopened its fabled doors. Then in 2023 it was designated a protected landmark due to its cultural significance. Jazz has been the pulsating soundtrack of this city for a century, Michael stresses. “It epitomises New York, as the music of spontaneity, evolution and frenetic energy.” Although jazz is no longer the pop music of America, as it was during its heyday, a vibrant scene still exists in the city. “A lot of young people are now passionate about it and there are still venues where you can hear it being played live. I play every week with my quintet at the Clover Club and there’s also a great cellar bar in the Village called Smalls Jazz Club, where you can catch sets most nights,” he says. Twenty years ago, Michael decided to rally together a “rag-tag group of vintage aficionados” and throw his first Jazz Age Lawn Party on New York’s Governors Island. This highlight of the summer season is a Roaring Twenties-style event, now held over two separate weekends and attracting more than 10,000 partygoers. “Everyone likes to talk about Gatsby’s parties. This is what it would have been like to receive an invite to his mansion,” Michael says. “People are getting tipsy, dancing the Charleston in their bias-cut flapper dresses and trying to outdo each other with their fancy picnics,” says the debonair musician with a smile, as we leave the tinkling pianos of Minton’s Playhouse behind to walk along one of Harlem’s tree-lined avenues. Gatsby’s era has left its fingerprints all over the city, historian Kevin Draper tells me when we meet later that afternoon outside the Rockefeller Center. “Somehow it was one of the biggest party decades of the century, yet alcohol was banned.” The founder of New York Historical Tours, Kevin is taking me to what was once New York City’s most notorious speakeasy, the 21 Club. It’s tucked behind an ornate black gate on 52nd Street, once known as Swing Street due to its wealth of hopping jazz clubs. After it was raided by the police in 1930, the owners created an illicit system of secret doorways and hidden wine cellars. (Prohibition's history on its 100th anniversary.) “There was even shelving on the bar where you’d hit a switch and bottles would disappear down a chute into the basement, should the place be raided again,” Kevin explains. The follow-up raid never materialised at the 21 Club, and its legacy lived on. Baseball player Joe DiMaggio would bring actress Marilyn Monroe here on dates and Michael Douglas and Charlie Sheen filmed scenes for Wall Street here. Sadly, the 21 Club closed its gilded doors for good during the pandemic, although there are whispers of a revival from its owners — minus the bootleggers and bathtub gin this time. A century ago, a sense of optimism danced in the air as the US was starting to discover its own swaggering identity, says Kevin, as we walk inside the Hotel Edison near Times Square. It’s an art deco hotel that opened in 1931 and features an indulgence of Jazz Age murals in the lobby. “It was no longer about looking towards Europe for our culture. A flip had happened where the world started watching America and suddenly there was jazz music playing in Parisian cafes. New York was really at the heart of it all, as the financial capital of the US,” he explains, as we gaze up at a painting depicting Harlem musicians. “I see a lot of parallels between the 1920s and today,” Kevin reflects. “A pandemic [Spanish influenza] was fading away, people were returning to the cities, women’s rights were being discussed and there was also this sense of excitement for the future.” I leave Kevin on the corner of Fifth Avenue and head onwards towards my glitzy digs for the night. The Plaza hotel has stood proudly by the leafy entrance of Central Park since making its debut in 1907. It received a starring role in The Great Gatsby, when, one stifling hot afternoon, Gatsby, Daisy Buchanan, her husband Tom, upper-crust athlete Jordan Baker and the book’s narrator Nick Carraway check into a ‘swell suite’ for an emotionally charged showdown, accompanied by mint julip cocktails and the sound of muffled chords escaping from the ballroom below. Not too much has changed at this grand dame of a hotel since The Great Gatsby’s author Fitzgerald was a regular here, fondly declaring that “nothing unimportant ever happens at The Plaza”. However, in more recent years a flamboyant 1920s-themed suite has been added, which I imagine Fitzgerald would have raised a glass of something bubbly to. Designed by Oscar-winning set designer Catherine Martin, collaborator and wife of Baz Luhrmann, who directed the 2013 blockbuster The Great Gatsby, the one-bedroom suite is situated on the 18th floor. A white-gloved butler eases open the gold decorative door for me, revealing a treasure trove of art deco furnishings and knowing Gatsby references. A silver polo trophy dazzles on a shelf, engraved with Tom Buchanan’s name, beside framed photos of Fitzgerald and his wife Zelda, and an antique gramophone that looks ready to spring to life at any moment playing the Beale Street Blues. I sink into the opulent bed and drift off to sleep beneath a twinkling, kaleidoscopic chandelier, just as the protagonist Gatsby may have done, had his own visit to The Plaza ended a little less abruptly. The next morning, I board the train to Long Island, a 118-mile stretch of land extending into the ocean in southeastern New York, which Fitzgerald described as “that slender riotous island”. It was here on Long Island’s North Shore that Gatsby spent a long, hazy summer rattling around in his enormous palace, throwing increasingly outrageous parties in the hope of attracting the attention of the flighty socialite Daisy Buchanan. Director Baz Luhrmann also spent a summer on Long Island, checking out its country homes while researching his 2013 film adaptation of the novel. I follow in his footsteps by calling in at the Vanderbilt Museum. This stately pile from the Gilded Age was the home of one of America’s wealthiest families, who collected the spoils of their grand tour travels to display like an enormous cabinet of curiosities. I browse the archives, which include a 32ft-long whale shark suspended from the ceiling and an Egyptian mummy, snapped up from a shop in Cairo in 1932. The mansion’s saltwater swimming pool, glistening through the window, is now painted as green as a jungle and crowned with a spouting fountain, thought to have influenced the design of Leonardo DiCaprio’s onscreen pool when he played Gatsby in Luhrmann’s movie. But it’s Oheka Castle, 10 miles away on Long Island’s North Shore, which is credited as the main inspiration for Gatsby’s splendid movie mansion. My taxi crunches along the sweeping gravel pathway lined with red cedar trees to stop before what was the second-largest private home in America. Once the residence of Otto Kahn, a self-made millionaire with a taste for the high life, construction on the mansion began in 1917 and was modelled on a French chateau. It has since been revived as a hotel with 34 guest rooms, and is now favoured as a wedding venue and open to visitors for guided tours. It’s easy to picture Gatsby living the American Dream in this grandiose setting, reclining in a marble clawfoot bath, gazing out upon the manicured gardens where 10 reflective pools are dotted with Grecian statues, or slipping through the concealed doorway disguised as a wooden bookcase in the estate’s handsome library. His creator, Fitzgerald, must have also had this same vision, while attending wildly lavish parties at Oheka Castle, where the world and its mistress — plus the actor Charlie Chaplin and the legendary director Orson Welles — came to down gin rickeys clinking with ice. These days, the revellers are all long gone. But their glamorous ghosts still haunt contemporary New York, hiding in the shadows of its hopping jazz joints, art deco temples, ritzy hotels and Long Island mansions. You just have to know where to find them, old sport.

TITLE: Meet the female rappers carving out a home in Nashville, America's Music City
DATE: 
CONTENT:
In America’s country music capital, a new generation is stepping out from the shadows of its beloved honky-tonks. Meet the trailblazing female rappers singing ‘Music City’ a different song. It’s early evening in Nashville and classic country music drifts from the doorway of a nearby honky-tonk bar. Peeking inside the dingy dive, I see a four- piece band in matching western-wear owning the stage. Their rhinestone costumes dazzle under the spotlights as they serenade the crowd, who look amped for a night of serious two-stepping. For me it’s too early to start line dancing, so I continue strolling along Lower Broadway — commonly known as Honky Tonk Highway — past a chorus of Stetson-wearing revellers and glowing neon signs shaped like cowboys and giant guitars. At first glimpse of the thronging streets of Tennessee’s capital, it would be easy to write this city off as a stuck record, playing heartbreak songs on repeat. Yet I’m here to meet a new wave of musical talent — the south’s female rappers, who are picking up the mic and bringing greater diversity to its hallowed music scene. Nashville has been a nerve centre of America’s music industry since the 1800s, home to major songwriting publishing houses and recording studios. It was a Black choir who helped earn Nashville its nickname — when Queen Victoria met the Fisk Jubilee Singers during a 1873 world tour, she reputedly declared they must be from a ‘city of music’ — but it’s country music that made it famous. After the 1925 launch of weekly live show the Grand Ole Opry, the twang of banjos, fiddles and steel guitars stole the limelight here. Country continues to be the sound most associated with Nashville, at least partly responsible for attracting nearly 17 million annual visitors to the booming city. To find the beat of a different drum in this city, the next day I arrange to meet a rising star of the US rap world, 28-year-old Daisha McBride. She’s offered to show me her side of Nashville and we’re starting at her favourite pizzeria, Slim & Husky’s, located in the creative Buchanan Arts District to the north of the city. She arrives wearing a baseball cap, beaded bracelets on her wrists and a ready smile. Over an artisan thin-crust margherita named ‘Got 5 on it’ in homage to Luniz’s 1995 hit, Daisha points out a medley of other musical references. “This place is hip-hop inspired, from the music that’s playing to the names of the pizzas, which reference famous rap songs,” she says. “It’s all about amplifying Black music.” Video footage of her performing at a gig supported by Slim & Husky’s flashes up on a wall-mounted screen. Daisha’s Tennessee upbringing helped shape her musical vocabulary. Born in Knoxville in the Smoky Mountains, the leafy Appalachian foothills that also raised Dolly Parton, Daisha was already riffing on her surroundings and creating her own lyrics by the tender age of 10. “Growing up in east Tennessee, the vibe was lots of folk, country and rock,” she says. “And then over in Memphis, in western Tennessee, there was blues, jazz and trap [a distinctively southern style of hip-hop with a heavy bassline] music.” As a young adult, Daisha moved to Nashville — known as ‘the buckle’ of the Bible Belt because of its central location and Christian music industry — and discovered a harmonious melting pot of influences. “One of the cool things about Tennessee is that it’s actually super diverse,” she says. “You’ll often get this crossover between the genres.” We head onwards to the bohemian neighbourhood of east Nashville for a spot of thrifting at Music City Vintage. Inside this vast warehouse treasure trove — which counts the Canadian rapper Drake as a customer — walls are splashed with funky murals and rails are crammed with a selection of hard-to-find urban streetwear. As we browse nostalgic T-shirts from the 1990s and coveted retro Nascar jackets, Daisha reflects that Nashville’s non-traditional movement has been largely powered by the musicians themselves, tired of waiting for opportunities from industry gatekeepers. “If you’re not invited to the table, you have to build your own,” she says, skimming through a rack of silky baseball jerseys. Despite being the subject of a documentary made by the legendary singer and actress Queen Latifah, amassing over 180,000 Instagram followers and achieving a million downloads of her single, Birds, Daisha remains an unsigned artist. Instead, she’s bootstrapping her own path. “I’ll hit up a Nashville venue to perform a show and let people know through social media,” she says. We stop to admire a wall of shrink-wrapped collectable trainers, some of which are so rare they’ll fetch hundreds of dollars. “Some spaces do a great job of making themselves inclusive,” says Daisha, citing Nashville venues like Exit/In, Acme Feed & Seed, The Basement and The Basement East as examples. “And the honky-tonks have multiple floors. You’ll have a live band playing country covers on the ground floor, but often the upper floors will have a DJ spinning in some hip-hop with pop.” Our next stop, just down the street, is Grimey’s New & Preloved Music, a former church resurrected as a retail shrine to vinyl records. Championing up-and-coming talent since 1999, this independent store maintains a community vibe. “Everyone has a lot of love and respect for Grimey’s,” says Daisha fondly as she walks through the door. Heading straight to the alternative section, she starts pulling out albums by local melody makers including Maggie Rose and Alanna Royale. To give struggling artists a morale boost, Grimey’s often commissions painted portraits of lesser-known musicians to appear on its facade, and its wooden aisles are filled with LPs spanning from blues pioneer Robert Johnson to obscure European folk collectives. Music-lovers regularly gather at this lo-fi store to hear free gigs performed on a dinky stage tucked away in the back, Daisha tells me, pointing out the huge rainbow Pride flag rippling over the entrance. “I’m a triple minority — a woman, Black and queer — so any place I can walk in that feels inclusive is always appreciated,” she says, smiling. Nashville supports stores like Grimey’s with such enthusiasm, customers queue overnight to buy exclusive vinyls released on the annual record store appreciation day in April, an international event that in Nashville brings block party celebrations, vinyl pressings, food trucks and of course plenty of live music. In return, Grimey’s blows the trumpet for local artists like Daisha — her latest releases are in pride of place at the front of the store. Daisha is hoping to add to this back catalogue, and offers to show me Diamond Sound Studios in the Metro Center area, where she’s working on new material with her producer Sci-Fi. Leaning back on her chair between tunes, the rapper describes how the 2021 opening of the National Museum of African American Music (NMAAM) was further acknowledgement of Nashville’s rich Black music legacy. “I love that it’s right there on Broadway, just across the road from the Ryman Auditorium,” she says, referring to the historic music venue where Elvis, Johnny Cash, Dolly Parton and Taylor Swift have all graced the fabled wooden stage. “Its central location makes an important statement; it says that Black music is part of Music City too.” Back downtown, a guest experience associate at NMAAM shows me around the museum’s interactive galleries. Romello Smith wears smart wire-framed glasses and a clipped beard, his diamond earring twinkling as he walks me through 400 years of R&B, hip-hop, gospel, jazz and blues history. “Over here is DeFord Bailey,” he says, gesturing to a photo of the sharp-suited harmonica star, who in 1927 became the first African American artist to perform at the Grand Ole Opry. “At that time, it was taboo for a Black artist to play there, so he really broke the colour barrier.” We pass one of many guitars that BB King named ‘Lucille’, and a room where visitors joyfully hit the high notes as part of a virtual reality gospel choir. “And let’s not forget Jimi Hendrix!” says Romello. “Having left the military he came straight to Printers Alley to cut his musical teeth.” By the 1940s, Nashville’s former printing district had evolved into an entertainment hotspot, filled with saloons and nightclubs. “In Nashville today you’ll find talent like Allison Russell: a Black social justice folk singer who’s just about the best artist in the city right now,” he says, as our tour reaches a crescendo at NMAAM’s hip-hop gallery. A few blocks away is another of Daisha’s recommendations, Acme Feed & Seed, where I round off the day with flaming hot Nashville chicken, eaten while perched at the bar as an indie-rock band thrash it out under the music venue’s flickering stage lights. The following morning, for my encore, I make my way over to Clear Waters Studio, which specialises in recording with non-country artists including local female rappers such as Sweet Poison and Meme Jenkins. Here I find 29-year-old hip-hop artist Mia Reona, working on some new music. She was raised in Nashville’s Jefferson Street district, an area with significant African American heritage, and takes a break to tell me about how the city has influenced her musical style. “Growing up here, it was kind of inevitable that I listened to country,” she says, taking a seat on a weathered Chesterfield sofa. “And I’ve since dabbled with multiple genres in my own music — rhyming over country beats, for example.” Behind her is an illuminated mixing station, plus a stack of speakers and cables piled high like a plate of spaghetti. Mia isn’t the only one breaking down Nashville’s musical barriers. “I think Beyoncé’s Cowboy Carter album helped open people’s minds. When it launched, there were a lot of themed parties where people of colour were showing up in full attire. Chaps, cowboy hats — the whole thing,” she recalls with a grin. Nevertheless, the women in this space are pioneers. “The scene is still pretty male dominated,” Mia tells me. “The Tennessee hip-hop stars who’ve broken through are mostly male artists, like Young Buck or Yo Gotti.” While there are plenty of women in the industry, she says they tend to be behind-the-scenes grafters in roles such as artist promotion or tour manager, as opposed to the headline act. “But things are slowly changing here in Nashville. Country music always gets more shine, but there’s a growing awareness of the other genres floating around the city, too. It’s quite normal to see a rock act followed by a hip-hop artist on a night out now.” As Mia returns to the microphone, I take the scenic route back along Lower Broadway — past the honky-tonks playing cry-into-your-beer country. This time I take Daisha’s advice and climb the staircases, up to the hidden spaces playing Nashville’s alternative genres — the future of Music City.

TITLE: Where to try the 6 traditional dishes served on ‘No Taste Like Home with Antoni Porowski’
DATE: 
CONTENT:
These traditional family recipes each tell a story about ancestral heritage. Here's how you can try each one—from tortellini en brodo in Italy to jajangmyeon in South Korea. In National Geographic’s series No Taste Like Home with Antoni Porowski, six Hollywood stars follow the Queer Eye star on a journey through food and time as they travel through their ancestral homelands in search of family history. Starting with just one homemade family recipe, Porowski helps stars Awkwafina, Justin Theroux, Issa Rae, James Marsden, Florence Pugh, and Henry Golding connect with their pasts by eating foods that fed their ancestral lineages and exploring the places they once called home. (Related: Antoni Porowski wants you to learn about your ancestors—through their recipes.) With its roots in Northern China, jajangmyeon is among Korea’s most popular dishes, available at thousands of restaurants across the world alongside dozens of instant and frozen versions at grocery stores. The dish, recognizable by its signature glossy, midnight hue, is a variation of the Chinese dish zhajiangmian that migrant workers from Shandong brought to Korea in the late 19th century. Jajangmyeon is a rich yet hearty dish, typically made with wheat noodles, ground or diced meat and/or seafood, vegetables (like zucchini or cabbage), and aromatics including ginger and garlic, and chunjang, the sweet-savory caramelized black bean paste that gives the dish its distinctive black shade. The dish is so well-known and beloved that it plays a starring role in the unofficial Korean holiday, Black Day, on April 14, when single people celebrate or commiserate their singledom with friends over a bowl of jajangmyeon. Where to try it in Korea: Almost anywhere. This dish is so ubiquitously known and loved that there are tens of thousands of places to find it in Seoul alone, but the Chinese restaurant Ehwawon (이화원) in Yeonhui-dong has been perfecting its silky version for three generations. (Related: Everything you need to know about bibimbap, Korea's famous rice dish.) Traditionally found in cities like Bologna and Modena in Italy’s Emilia-Romagna region, tortellini en brodo is a regional specialty, highlighting the quality and history of its ingredients. This dish should not be confused with tortelli (this dish’s larger namesake), tortelloni (also larger but with different fillings and preparation), or ravioli (different shape, different fillings). Tortellini is pint-sized, barely an inch big, and folded into chubby rings stuffed with a mixture of meat, like prosciutto or mortadella, Parmigiano-Reggiano, and nutmeg. Once filled and folded, the tortellini is simmered in a golden broth made traditionally with capon, a castrated male chicken, or a mixture of chicken and beef bones and served to float in the savory soup. Where to try it in Italy:  Some of the best examples of regional cuisine, including tortellini en brodo, can be found at Trattoria di via Serra or All’Osteria Bottega in Bologna. Both restaurants are mentioned in the Michelin Guide’s Bologna Restaurants, with Trattoria di via Serra receiving a coveted Bib Gourmand award. (Related: Chef Angela Hartnett's guide to eating in Emilia-Romagna.) This okra and seafood stew is one of Western Africa’s most popular dishes and is usually found in many of the countries along the Atlantic coast from Senegal to Guinea. Born from the region’s rich fishing traditions, this stew uses a multitude of fish, fresh and dried shellfish, okra, peppers, and other aromatics simmered in candy-apple red palm oil. Once simmered and reduced, this thick stew is often served family-style over rice. Though this dish might be unfamiliar at first for many diners outside Africa and the African diasporas, you’ve likely eaten or heard of its later incarnation. If you’ve ever visited New Orleans or the Creole regions of the world, soupe kanja is the progenitor for one of this cuisine’s most iconic dishes: gumbo. Where to try it in Senegal: In Dakar, the family-owned Chez Loutcha is a popular and colorful local haunt that serves Senegalese staples alongside Cape Verdian and other menu items. (Related: Drumbeats and heartstrings: tuning in to the rhythms of Senegal.) Chicken with mushrooms and bamboo possibly gets its influence from multiple sources. The first, manuk pansuh—or chicken cooked in a bamboo stalk with tapioca or cassava leaves—is a staple of Sarawak cuisine and is often prepared during festivals by the Iban and the Bidayuh peoples. The meat is typically seasoned with aromatics like torch ginger, galangal, and lemongrass before being stuffed into the bamboo. The second influence comes by way of Malaysia’s significant Chinese population, which has existed across Malaysia and the Indonesian archipelago as early as the 13th century. Various versions of a dish featuring chicken with mushrooms and bamboo shoots can be found in both China and Malaysia and are made with ingredients that would be easy to source in the mountainous regions of both countries. Where to try it in Borneo: Serving Sarawak cuisine for more than a decade, Lepau Restaurant in Kuching showcases dishes from numerous indigenous communities, including Iban, Kelabit, Ulu, Bidayuh, and beyond, offering diners a rich entry point into this region’s most celebrated foods. (Related: We are what we eat: Diving for dinner with the sea gypsies.) Like many recipes from the 18th and 19th centuries, shepherd’s pie was a way for families with little money or access to expensive ingredients, like prime cuts of meat, to stretch what they had to feed the household. First referred to as cottage pie in the late 18th century, this dish has changed very little from its original recipe and still features many of the same ingredients. Ingredients for this British dish include ground beef or lamb/mutton (a fairly accessible ingredient for the sheep farming region in this dish’s early days) and diced vegetables in a rich gravy. One of shepherd’s pie's distinct identifiers is its pillowy mashed potato topping, which is spooned atop the hearty meat mixture and baked to crisp, golden brown perfection. Where to try it in the UK: The Ivy restaurant has posted its iconic version of shepherd's pie online for people who are unable to make the trip to the restaurant, located in London. (Related: Where you can find the best British pubs that serve food.) This simple and beloved Southern American diner classic has changed very little from its European ancestors. Similar to Austria’s wiener schnitzel, chicken-fried steak is just that, typically a thin cut of beef, often a tenderized cube steak, dredged in flour and eggs before frying. The breading and frying technique gives the dish its signature name, though technically, pan-frying instead of deep-frying would make this dish “country-fried”. German and Austrian immigrants who migrated to Texas in the 19th century and later became cattle farmers are believed to have brought chicken-fried steak to the United States. It’s one of the tastes of home these communities carried with them to America, says rancher Jim Kearney. “Food is the last thing to go,” says Kearney. “That’s what people hold onto as a symbol of their former life or wherever they came from.” Where to try it in Texas: Dallas’ original farm-to-table Celebration Restaurant has perfected its grass-fed, chicken-fried steak for more than 50 years. Make sure to order it with the house specialty spicy jalapeno gravy.

TITLE: Where to travel in April
DATE: 
CONTENT:
Spring is here — even if there’s still some late-season snow in the Alps — with Dutch tulip festivities, the Cotswolds in bloom and celebratory water fights across Thailand. Here’s where you shouldn’t miss this month. April is the month where there's all to play for. The Med is back in action for sun and coastal fun, putting short-haul escapes to the beaches within easy reach once again, while the last of the Alpine snow keeps winter sports lovers entertained for just a bit longer. In most resorts across the Alps, the ski season closes this month, with some high-octane, high-altitude festivals to see it out — among them Zermatt Unplugged in Switzerland, which brings nearly 70 different artists to the mountains. Further afield, Thai new year celebrations see its cities making a splash, Coachella kicks off the summer's music festivals out in the California desert and travel is enriched by Easter celebrations worldwide. In more northerly latitudes, April sees peak spring displays of tulips and ornamental Japanese flowering cherry trees. You’ll find some of the best of the latter this month in the Cotswolds, on Hamburg's over 5,000 cherry trees and during the cherry blossom festivities in Berlin's Gardens of the World park — with similar celebrations in northern cities such as Copenhagen and Stockholm. Mid-April marks the traditional new year in much of Southeast Asia, and in Thailand the festival of Songkran (13-15 April) sees cities and towns nationwide erupt into a three-day water fight. Alongside solemn rituals at Buddhist temples — where monks use water for spiritual purification, cleansing any grievances from the past year and blessing the one to come — you'll find stalls selling canon-sized water pistols, buckets and cups that become a repository for both watery ammo — a sticky mixture of clay and water — and cocktails. This is the hottest time of year, so a good soaking is always welcome and generally met with good humour. The northern capital of Chiang Mai makes the biggest splash, while the Khao San Road is Bangkok's Songkran centre, with streets of the backpacker district cordoned off for revelries. (5 ways to experience Thai wellness on Koh Samui and Koh Phangan.) Late season in the Espace Killy ski area is a safe bet for winter sports lovers as the slopes stay open until the end of the month. Snow coverage isn't as guaranteed as it once was anywhere in the Alps, but the higher you go, the better chance there is for the slopes to remain covered into spring. Dominated by the major resorts of Val d’Isère (6,070ft) and Tignes (6,560ft), the region benefits from the former's largely north-facing slopes and the latter's high-altitude skiing on the Grande Motte glacier (11,338ft) for up to nine months of the year. Add to this a combined 190 miles of slopes with runs to suits all levels of skier and boarder (plus tobogganing, snow shoeing, husky sledding and even ice diving), as well as a good range of lifts allowing you to ride right back into town should your legs, or the snow, give up, and you've something to appeal to pretty much everyone. (The inside guide to dining and drinking in the French mountain town of Tignes.) April is a bumper month for colourful Dutch celebrations. On the 26th, its Koningsdag when orange-clad revellers take to the streets nationwide to celebrate the king’s birthday during a one-day national holiday, enjoyed in Amsterdam with a maze of flea markets, canal-side parties and myriad music festivals. But if you want to expand your colour spectrum beyond orange (the national hue worn in homage to ‘the House of Oranje’ Dutch monarchy) tulip season will more than satisfy. Blooms are at their peak this month in and around the city, augmented by the March to April stretching Tulip Festival bringing special plantings, parades and events to parks and gardens. Batsford Arboretum is home to the UK’s National Collection of Japanese flowering cherry trees — with more than 120 across the gardens, which is based just outside the pretty, honey-hued Cotswold market town of Moreton-in-Marsh. Blossom season is dictated each year, in part, by the weather, but the trees are usually at their best around mid-April. Just an hour's drive south, at Westonbirt, the National Arboretum also offers colourful displays of cherry trees, along with magnolias, camellias and rhododendrons early in spring, after which carpets of native bluebells roll out across woodland glades. Further afield, the Cotswold's numerous nature reserves are prime places for spring flower walks, including Littleworth Wood on the fringes of  Snowshill Manor and Garden, and the Foxholes and Frith Wood nature reserves, which are all awash with bluebells anywhere from late March well into May.

Make it to this sunny southern Spanish city to experience its famed Semana Santa celebrations, where countless colourful processions take place at once throughout each day. Bridging the two Sundays leading up to Easter, this Holy Week is one of the most sought out annual events across Spain, attracting both devoted locals and travellers from around the world. With its roots dating back to the 16th century, Semana Santa was, as much as it is today, a way for ordered brotherhoods to celebrate the passion and death of Christ by organising processions as marks of their religious dedication. To this day their grand shows of faith alongside the beat of drums and burnt incense lend Seville an electric atmosphere even non-believers enjoy. (Dive deeper: a neighbourhood guide to Seville.)
