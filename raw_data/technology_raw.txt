TITLE: ‘Startup Nation’ Groups Say They’re Meeting Trump Officials to Push for Deregulated ‘Freedom Cities’
DATE: Mar 7, 2025 2:48 PM
CONTENT:
Several groups representing “startup nations”—tech hubs exempt from the taxes and regulations that apply to the countries where they are located—are drafting Congressional legislation to create “freedom cities” in the US that would be similarly free from certain federal laws, WIRED has learned. According to interviews and presentations viewed by WIRED, the goal of these cities would be to have places where anti-aging clinical trials, nuclear reactor startups, and building construction can proceed without having to get prior approval from agencies like the Food and Drug Administration, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and the Environmental Protection Agency. Trey Goff, the chief of staff of the startup nation known as Próspera, tells WIRED that he and other Próspera representatives working under an advocacy group called the Freedom Cities Coalition have been meeting with the Trump administration about the idea in recent weeks. He claims the administration has been very receptive. In 2023, Trump floated the idea of creating 10 freedom cities. Now, Goff says that Próspera’s vision is to create “not just 10, but as many as the market can handle.” They hope to have drafted legislation ready by the end of the year. “The energy in DC is absolutely electric,” Goff says. “You can tell in meetings with the people involved that they have the mandate to do some of the more hyperbolic, verbose things Trump has mentioned.” According to Goff, Freedom Cities Coalition has briefed White House officials on three options for creating freedom cities. One is through “interstate compacts.” In this scenario, two or more states could set aside territories with shared tax and regulation policies, with some state-specific carve-outs. Under existing law, these compacts can’t be revoked, though they can be dissolved under certain circumstances. If an interstate compact is approved by Congress, it becomes valid under federal law. Goff says the coalition is considering Congressional legislation that would give “advanced consent” to any freedom city compacts. That way, Congress wouldn’t need to approve each individual city. Two other options are creating federal enclaves with special economic and jurisdictional zones, or having Trump issue executive orders to create each new freedom city. “It depends on what Trump and the White House want to do,” Goff says. “Whatever pathway they want to take, we want to help them make that a reality.” The White House did not respond to a request for comment from WIRED. Freedom Cities Coalition was created by an entity called NeWay Capital LLC, which owns several trademarks for Próspera. Since opening on the Honduran island of Roatán in 2020, Próspera has been attracting tech workers and startups by promising low taxes, few regulations, and a businesslike government that considers its citizens to be akin to customers. Its financiers include Pronomos Capital, a venture capital firm backed by Peter Thiel and Marc Andreessen, and Coinbase. Startup nations outside the US have largely relied on the creation of special economic zones (SEZs), where the regular rules governing businesses are waived, often in order to attract foreign investment. The hope, it appears, is to bring a similar model to the US. Notably, the current government of Honduras considers Próspera and its special economic status to be illegal. The country’s previous president, Juan Orlando Hernández, gave Próspera a permanent charter to operate on its own terms. However, many Honduran citizens opposed Próspera, arguing that it has increased poverty and worsened biodiversity in the area. The Honduran Congress passed a law in 2022 repealing the allowance of SEZs, and Próspera sued the Honduran government shortly after. The lawsuit is ongoing. President Donad Trump mentioned the idea of freedom cities on the campaign trail in March 2023. He promised that if he was elected president, he would hold a contest to pick 10 winners to build their own freedom cities on federal land. Trump hasn’t referred to the idea in public since, but Goff says he’s confident that it wasn’t a throwaway line from the president. “It’s not just a marketing tactic—they take it very literally,” Goff adds, referring to members of Trump’s team. “They intend to follow through with all of the promises they made on the campaign trail.” Freedom Cities Coalition isn’t the only group currently lobbying the Trump administration. Frontier Foundation, a 501c4 organization, is working in partnership with the nonprofit Charter Cities Institute to bring freedom cities to the US. Jeffrey Mason, the head of policy at the Charter Cities Institute, tells WIRED that several other groups have recently joined their effort, including the Housing Center at the American Enterprise Institute and the Foundation for American Innovation. They’re drafting legislation that Mason says should be ready “hopefully sometime in the next several months.” He adds that members of these groups are having “casual conversations with people in the White House,” in addition to Republican and Democratic members of Congress. In a 2025 memo shared with WIRED, the Frontier Foundation argues that “domestic innovation and production has been significantly impeded for decades by outdated and unnecessarily restrictive federal regulation.” Frontier Foundation president Nick Allen tells WIRED that using federal land would lower the cost of development for startup cities. The Frontier Foundation suggests that federally owned land outside western cities like Boise, Idaho; Grand Junction, Colorado; and Redmond, Oregon would be suitable candidates. “If we're able to get a legislative transfer of land from the US government to make a public-private partnership, or a trust, or even a private corporation, then it's a lower cost of capital,” he explains. The Frontier Foundation memo also recommends allowing private landowners to become freedom cities and to “allow municipalities to vote to become Freedom Cities, allow Freedom Cities to expand with the consent of the contiguous land owners.” When asked why the Freedom Cities movement has chosen not to focus on revitalizing existing post-industrial cities like Detroit or Toledo, Ohio, Allen tells WIRED that “when you're building these new facilities, you need to sort of start from scratch.” He noted that Joe Biden signed an executive order instructing the federal departments to lease federal lands to be used as data centers in the final days of his administration. “There's so much capital and there's so much political will, but yet there's an inability to develop these technologies,” says Allen. “And the inability comes from lack of space and too many regulations.” But Gil Duran, a former political consultant and author of the Substack newsletter Nerd Reich, warns that building new cities from scratch could have negative consequences. “To be outside of the law and above the law, what does that mean for the rest of the country?” he asks. “It seems like you're going to start hollowing out other places in order to have these places where the rules are suspended and don't apply anymore to certain people.” Goff says that unlike Próspera, which has an entirely different tax structure from surrounding Honduras, freedom cities in the US would likely pay a similar amount in state and federal taxes as other American cities. The main difference would be how the cities are regulated. One company that stands to benefit from the rise of freedom cities is Minicircle, a longevity biotech company focused on developing gene therapies to extend human lifespans. The company’s seed funding came from Thiel and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, and it currently has offices in both Austin, Texas, and Próspera. Minicircle cofounder Mac Davis is also working with the Frontier Foundation. Davis says that Minicircle’s gene therapy clinical trial on the protein follistatin—which he claims increases muscle mass without side effects, and also has life-extending benefits in mice—was only possible in Próspera, but noted he’d like to see that change. “I'd like a ‘longevity city’ where everyone and their dog is on gene therapy,” Davis says. Davis adds that he can imagine many other companies benefiting from freedom cities, including SpaceX, the defense hardware and software company Anduril, and Oklo, a nuclear fission startup chaired by Sam Altman. Many of the industries Allen says he hopes to foster in Freedom Cities–energy, nuclear, semiconductors, and defense technology–are, not coincidentally, ones “a lot of venture [capital] is going towards” as funding moves away from SaaS, digital, and internet consumer brands. “The theme is American Dynamism,” he says, referencing the 2022 manifesto from venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, which argues that “the scientific and operational excellence of consequential technology companies made up for the shortfall of our flailing governmental institutions.” Since 2021, venture capitalists have plowed more than $100 billion into defense tech startups alone. Some tech companies have been considering revitalizing nuclear power in order to sustain AI data centers, which use a huge amount of energy. Amazon signed several nuclear power agreements last year, Google made a deal with a nuclear power company in October 2024, and Meta is asking for proposals on how the company can leverage nuclear power. Goff tells WIRED that he thinks freedom cities could also be used as manufacturing hubs and shipbuilding ports, allowing builders to bypass the environmental review process. Mason says the American Enterprise Institute, which is partnering with the Frontier Foundation and Charter Cities Institute, is eager to find ways to use freedom cities to increase housing. Mason says he’s most excited about speeding up innovation in sectors like biotech and using nuclear power to power AI data centers. “There's a lot of exciting opportunities here, especially as we need a lot of data centers,” Mason says. “There's a lot of land that you can tap.” But Duran says that the same deregulation that could be seen as pro-business will likely not favor those outside Freedom Cities’ ultrawealthy backers. “These are going to be cities without democracy,” he claims. “These are going to be cities without workers' rights. These are going to be cities where the owners of the city, the corporations, the billionaires have all the power and everyone else has no power. That's what's so attractive about these sovereign entities to these people, is that they will actually be anti-freedom cities.”

TITLE: With GPT-4.5, OpenAI Trips Over Its Own AGI Ambitions
DATE: Mar 6, 2025 7:00 AM
CONTENT:
While the improvements feel as incremental as its name suggests, GPT-4.5 is still OpenAI’s most ambitious drop to date. Released in late February as a research preview—which essentially means OpenAI sees this as a beta version—GPT-4.5 uses more computing power than its previous models and was trained on more data. So, just how big is the GPT-4.5 research preview? Who knows—since the developers won’t say. And where did this additional training data come from? Their lips are zipped on that as well. To borrow a line from Apple TV’s hit show Severance, right now OpenAI is positioning the alleged improvements in this new model as mysterious and important. When comparing AI benchmark tests from competitors’ models as well as OpenAI’s “reasoning” releases, the benefits of using GPT-4.5 are not immediately clear. Though, in the model’s system card and in a previous interview with WIRED, the OpenAI researchers who worked on GPT-4.5 claimed improvements can be felt in the anthropomorphic aspects of the model, like a stronger intuition and a deeper understanding of emotion. After sitting in OpenAI’s office last year and listening to leadership talk about the startup's plan to further productize ChatGPT as useful software, this was not the release I expected in 2025. Rather than take a more utilitarian approach, this model attempts to be more emotional. OpenAI has steadily grown its number of enterprise contracts, so the company could be expected to put out tentpole releases with baked-in, practical applications, especially inside the most expensive and powerful version of its chatbot. However, GPT-4.5 is more aligned with the output from an academic research group pouring everything they have into chasing artificial general intelligence, a theoretical version of the algorithm that’s deft enough to replace white-collar workers and practically God-like in its ability to process information. While OpenAI would argue that these two paths are intertwined and equally important, if your short-term goal is to make money from ChatGPT, last week’s belabored release makes no sense; it’s super expensive and offers marginal gains only seasoned chatbot users may notice. But if your overarching mission is to build beneficial AGI, which is still OpenAI’s core objective, then mimicking the nuances of human emotions and soft skills remains a critical area for improvement. It’s where the company could hold onto its leading position as additional competitors in the generative AI race, like the vastly cheaper R1 model from DeepSeek, push forward on other innovations. As with most of the new features and models that arrive for ChatGPT, OpenAI’s paid subscribers will be the first to gain access to GPT-4.5. In this case, OpenAI is unlocking access first for ChatGPT Pro subscribers who pay a hefty $200 a month. The large rollout of GPT-4.5 to the other paid tiers—Plus, Team, Enterprise, and Edu—will happen during this week and the next. Past models have eventually trickled down to the free version of ChatGPT as well, but the company does not yet have a plan to release GPT-4.5 to all users, due to its size and computing requirements. When it becomes available in your account, GPT-4.5 will be one of the many options nestled in the model dropdown menu that appears when you click the word ChatGPT at the top of the screen. In my Pro account, this raised the current total number of available models to a whopping nine different choices that I now have to pick between. OpenAI developers have told me that they hope to significantly streamline that process in the future and have the AI tool pick which model is best suited for each prompt the user types or speaks. The draft headline I put on this article was “With GPT-4.5, OpenAI Gets Lost in the AGI Sauce.” And while no headline featuring the model’s name is going to feel poetic, that’s a bit of mess. Writing strong, succinct headlines is a difficult skill requiring clear communication as well as a level of aesthetic taste—often involving the input of multiple editors before the perfect message is conveyed. I was curious about whether ChatGPT would be able to punch up that headline, so I tried to do that using both the newest model and GPT-4o, a past release the company describes as “great for most tasks.” Among all the intangible improvements, GPT-4.5 was much more capable at writing a compelling headline. GPT-4o’s outputs were less interesting and had less variety overall, with the exception of this nonsensical banger: “With GPT-4.5, OpenAI Keeps One Foot in the Future, One in the Chatbot.” Here is a much better punch-up provided by the new model: “With GPT-4.5, OpenAI Trips Over Its Own AGI Ambitions.” It’s fairly similar to the original, but potentially more clear for readers. After some consternation, the human editors at WIRED decided to go with the headline generated by GPT-4.5. Fair enough. Switching gears, I asked why the price of a dozen eggs is rising even higher during the beginning of Trump’s presidency than it was under Biden, primarily to see which model would be more successful at analyzing web articles about a political topic. The differences here were more subtle, but GPT-4o seemed prone to lecture me and repeat itself, whereas GPT-4.5 did a better job of understanding my intent and succinctly representing multiple viewpoints. What about AI as a research partner? I’m working on a feature story right now and wanted to see if ChatGPT’s Deep Research tool, where it thinks for a little longer and produces more in-depth answers, would actually be helpful during the preparation process. After feeding pages of notes into GPT-4.5 and GPT-4o and waiting a few minutes, I was equally underwhelmed with both results. While the long-form output would likely be helpful for those without reporting experience, the interview questions it suggested I ask my sources for the story weren’t surprising or delightful. My time was better spent reading over my written notes again instead of the 4,000-word reports from ChatGPT. After spending a couple days generally chatting with GPT-4.5, the biggest positive I experienced was that the model makes ChatGPT feel less annoying and more conversational. This might sound trite, but it’s an important factor of the user experience. Small details like the use of casual language and one-word sentences made the bot feel less cloying during our chats. I could see myself picking GPT-4.5 just to avoid feeling like I’m asking some info-dumping sycophant for help. On the day of 4.5’s release, social media posts from CEO Sam Altman pointed to these more subtle changes as a step towards crafting AGI. He described the vibe of the new model as similar to chatting with a thoughtful human. “It’s a different kind of intelligence and there’s a magic to it i haven’t felt before,” he wrote on X. As it works on the eventual release of GPT-5, likely a more unified model that blends “reasoning” with other research innovations, OpenAI is looking for new ways to recoup the cost of training and running increasingly pricey frontier models. Altman floated the idea online of switching OpenAI’s subscription offerings into a credit-per-use system. Reporting from The Information even suggests OpenAI could charge tens of thousands of dollars a month for access to its best tools. I guess monthly access to a God-like AI, if you can achieve it, would drive a pretty steep subscription price as well. I’m excited to spend time testing GPT-4.5’s outputs head-to-head against competitors, like Anthropic’s Claude and X’s Grok, to see how the differences between recent model releases feel for users. Though, right now, I feel confident saying that OpenAI is at a crossroads, where trying both to turn ChatGPT into a sustainable software business and achieve AI superintelligence appear increasingly at odds.

TITLE: This Russian Tech Bro Helped Steal $93 Million and Landed in US Prison. Then Putin Called
DATE: Feb 25, 2025 6:00 AM
CONTENT:
Vladislav Klyushin was having, by any measure, an awful day. The judge in his case had brushed aside his lawyers’ arguments and his friends’ appeals for leniency. She handed down a tough sentence: nine more years in US federal prison, on top of an order to forfeit a fortune, $34 million. But if Klyushin was upset about the ruling, he didn’t show it. The then 42-year-old tech executive from Moscow seemed upbeat—quick with a smile on his pinchable cheeks and unerringly polite, just as he had been during his arrest near a Swiss ski resort in March 2021, his months of detention in Switzerland, his extradition to the United States that December, his indictment and trial on hacking and wire fraud charges, and his swift conviction. Klyushin “had a confidence all along that eventually the Russians would get him back,” one of his defense attorneys told me. He seemed certain that his protectors in the Kremlin would spare him from serving out his full sentence. There were times when that certainty seemed cocksure. America’s federal prison system held 35 Russian nationals. Surely not all of them were getting traded back. His family and friends were distraught. Within less than a year, though, Klyushin was proven right. On August 1, 2024, he was unshackled and put on a plane back to Moscow—one of the 24 people involved in the largest, most complex US-Russian prisoner exchange ever. You probably heard something about the swap. It’s the one that brought Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich and former US Marine Paul Whelan home to the United States—and sent back to Russia a Kremlin-linked assassin and a husband-and-wife duo of spies who were so deep undercover that their kids didn’t learn they were Russian until they got on the plane. In coverage of the exchange, Klyushin was treated as a footnote. That was a mistake, if an understandable one. And not just because he was at the center of one of the bigger insider trading cases of all time. The escalating conflict between the US and Russia has played out in all sorts of ways over the past decade. One American captive was swapped just two weeks ago; at least 10 more US citizens remain imprisoned in Russia. And now, there’s a Kremlin-friendly occupant of the Oval Office, one who loves to be seen as making deals. One is in global financial markets, with America and its allies walling more and more of Russian industry off from the international economy. There are always creative individuals who can find cracks in that wall, though, and Klyushin sure seems to have been one of them. You don’t have to squint too hard to see his scheme—which ultimately netted $93 million—as a way to bring capital into Russia, despite the global blockade. The contest has also been evident on the streets of Moscow, where a secretive Kremlin security force has grabbed American citizens, who are charged with bogus crimes, and then dangled them in trades for killers, spies, and associates of the Kremlin. It’s kidnapping, hostage taking, and it’s effectively all being done on President Vladimir Putin’s orders. Oftentimes, Americans are taken precisely for their value as assets to be later exchanged—to get back people like that assassin, or this financial crook, Klyushin. He wasn’t at the very top of Moscow’s trade list. But Klyushin was much closer, and more important to the Kremlin, than either side was willing to admit. To the outside world, Klyushin had a rags-to-riches, fairy-tale life, with a gauzy wedding video to prove it. In a montage later obtained by US prosecutors, Klyushin dives into a country club pool; his bride-to-be, Zhannetta, sips pink champagne on an outdoor bed draped with chiffon and roses; he picks her up in a white Porsche convertible; she’s gorgeous in her backless gown; he’s handsome, if a little goofy, in his tux and subtle mullet; they dance and laugh and stare meaningfully at the fireworks punctuating the perfect night. “I do not know a more decent person than my husband,” Zhannetta later wrote to the judge in his case. They had three children, adding to the two Klyushin had from a previous marriage. By all accounts, he was a doting father, a far cry from his own, a man he never met, or his stepfather, who was killed during a car robbery when Klyushin was 14. He emerged from a childhood of poverty to build a number of businesses. First, he was in construction and marketing; later, he ran an IT company called M13, which sold media- and internet-monitoring software to Russian government agencies. Early customers in 2016 included the Ministry of Defense and the office of the presidential administration, where Putin’s propaganda chief became an important proponent of M13. The company’s software was used to keep tabs on hundreds of Telegram channels for a Kremlin worried about the “introduction of unverified or knowingly false information,” according to one local news report. Klyushin’s rise was rapid, taking in more than $30 million in government contracts in a decade. That confounded some of his professional peers. (“The company and its owner are unknown to most in the IT community,” a respected Russian business journal noted in 2021.) But it brought him influence and admirers. He supported the arts and rebuilt the roof of the monastery on Moscow’s Lubyanka Street, a few blocks down from the headquarters of Russia’s spy service, the FSB. One friend later hailed Klyushin as an “eco-activist” (for planting “several spruces in the yard”) and a “pet-lover” (his “favourite pet is a dog”). “Broad-minded, well-read, educated,” gushed his family friend and tennis coach. An M13 employee said that a conversation with Klyushin “is like getting a lesson from a guru.” Moscow is filled with entrepreneurs who get rich by cozying up to the government; Klyushin seemed to reach another, higher level. He and M13 allegedly became so close to Moscow’s power brokers that an independent media outlet suggested he was one of the people behind an anonymous, inside-the-Kremlin Telegram channel with nearly 200,000 followers. Klyushin denied the allegation and successfully sued the outlet over the insinuation. Klyushin’s most consequential professional connection was with Ivan Ermakov, an internationally infamous hacker. It’s unclear when the two men met, but by April 2018 they were friendly enough to go heli-skiing together. Ermakov, a then 32-year-old with large, youthful brown eyes that made him look a decade younger, had recently served in Unit 26165 of Russia’s main intelligence directorate, the GRU. In cybersecurity and political circles, the unit was known as “Fancy Bear.” It was notorious for hacking into the networks of Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign and the Democratic National Committee, acts that helped throw the 2016 US election to Trump. Ermakov conducted some of Fancy Bear’s break-ins personally, American prosecutors alleged in 2018. This was around when Ermakov and Klyushin were attending the World Cup together in Sochi. Ermakov was indicted again that October for a series of Fancy Bear hacks around the 2016 summer Olympics. Ermakov made it onto an FBI most-wanted list. Klyushin kept a copy of the FBI poster in his iCloud account. At the time, Ermakov was obtaining information that would be central to Klyushin’s next big business venture: making money in the American stock market. According to encrypted chats later obtained by prosecutors, Klyushin would soon open a brokerage account through a Danish company, which Ermakov and an M13 employee appear to have used to make trades in a broad range of stocks—real-estate firms, natural gas concerns, food service businesses. At first, the endeavor didn’t go well. The chats show transactions being mistimed, information about companies miscommunicated, and price movements misunderstood. “The market behaves strangely,” says Ermakov. “We suck,” complains one M13 employee. The trades that did succeed, though, tended to have a common theme: They happened right before the companies released their regularly scheduled public earnings reports. It was as if Klyushin’s contacts had access to privileged information. Which, prosecutors say, they did. There are, broadly speaking, a few types of insider trading. Some prosecutors have come to call the more prevalent kind “golfer cases,” along the lines of an executive at a public company passing confidential information on the links to a buddy, who then plays the market. It’s illegal but often relatively constrained: one insider, one company. (Actual golf legend Phil Mickelson paid back more than $1 million in connection with one such case in 2016.) A rarer, potentially more destructive kind of insider trading involves finding a choke point in the flow of financial information and obtaining confidential data about dozens, hundreds, even thousands of companies at once. That’s what happened in the early 2010s, when a Ukrainian hacker broke into press release distributors like PR Newswire and exfiltrated before-it’s-public information on dozens of different companies. That hack allegedly resulted in around $30 million in illegal profits. For reasons that aren’t entirely clear, Klyushin kept a printout about the PR Newswire hacker in a pink, translucent folder. He—or someone—snapped a photo of the article next to a bottle of rosé. Klyushin and Ermakov’s insider trading scheme started, investigators believe, in early to mid 2018. (The details below were drawn from court records, trial transcripts, and evidence submitted during a later trial.) That’s when some awfully strange behavior started occurring in the networks of Donnelley Financial Solutions—a document management firm that prepares earnings reports for big, publicly traded companies. On May 9, the account of a longtime Donnelley employee, Julie Soma, started downloading a flurry of confidential financial reports that had been prepared for client companies. That was something she’d “never” do, Soma later testified. The browser and operating system information associated with her account’s burst of activity also didn’t match her normal behavior. Plus, all of this was happening late at night, way past the hours Soma typically worked from her home in Richland, Washington. Several other accounts also displayed atypical behavior, and at least one Donnelley-linked laptop, in London, was found to have a suspicious tool on it. This program, which allowed the computer to be remote-controlled, tried to collect usernames and passwords inside Donnelley’s networks, then cover its tracks by deleting the system logs. Finally, the tool attempted to connect the laptop to a bogus site, “investmentcomp.com”—a classic hacker trick to covertly collect data from a victim’s system. In November, a Donnelley competitor was hit too. At Toppan Merrill, investigators later discovered that a program called DirBuster was making multiple guesses per second to identify file names and network paths. Other malicious software echoed what was happening on the Donnelley machines. Klyushin’s investments, meanwhile, were expanding. He bought stock in semiconductor manufacturers, roofing suppliers, a firm that makes boats for wakeboarding. At almost every turn, Mikhail Irzak and Igor Sladkov, two associates of Ermakov’s from St. Petersburg, bought those same stocks. (Irzak, Sladkov, and Ermakov were all also indicted.) The volume of their trades often dwarfed Klyushin’s. When he purchased 1,350 shares of Tesla just ahead of its earnings report that fall, the St. Petersburg duo bought 16,300. Klyushin netted an estimated $9,000 from the deal; they got more than $145,000. Prosecutors never established a direct link between Klyushin and Ermakov’s friends from St. Petersburg. But one of those buddies had an internal M13 messaging app in his iCloud account, even though he was never an employee or client of the firm. An economist for the US Securities and Exchange Commission later put the odds of the group’s trading patterns being a coincidence at less than one in a trillion. The scheme attracted more investors. Ermakov and Klyushin shared their tips with the new clients and took a 60 percent cut of anything those outside investors made. One newcomer ran an audiovisual and IT company; M13 had recently pitched it on a whitehat hacker-for-hire package. Two other investors were described by Klyushin’s attorneys as old friends of his: former mining executive Aleksandr Borodaev and Boris Varshavskiy, who received the “Gold Badge of Distinction of Russian Coal” and briefly served as the minister of ecology and natural resources for a region in southern Siberia. “I did the math for Boris,” Klyushin texted Ermakov in May 2019. “The profit comes to 198% … Boris earned $989k on $500k … They don’t even ask why.” (Neither Borodaev nor Varshavskiy was charged in the US. It was not established at trial that either of them knew about the insider trading scheme.) Ermakov responded with a thumbs-up and three laugh-cry emojis. The pair grew closer—hitting the sauna, going out to dinners with the M13 crew. They texted about their favorite TV shows. Klyushin was really into Billions, about a hedge fund manager who made it big off of insider trading. On July 16, 2019, the Julie Soma account at Donnelley Financial downloaded an upcoming press release from the sneaker company Skechers. The document—one of more than 2,000 files illicitly downloaded using Soma’s credentials—showed that business was booming in the second quarter, well above what the market was expecting. “We buy SKX today,” wrote Ermakov on the morning of July 18 in the encrypted chat, referring to Skechers’ symbol on the New York Stock Exchange. The St. Petersburg pair snatched up 130,000 shares; Klyushin, almost 50,000; his mining buddies, 77,500. The earnings officially dropped at 4:05 pm ET that day. SKX shot up from $34 to $39. Klyushin’s crew liquidated almost all of their positions immediately. Klyushin was pumped. “So … What did we earn today? Our comrades are wondering,” he wrote in the encrypted group chat, and he posted photos of Borodaev and Varshavskiy. Ermakov, who months earlier was fine texting about the outside investors, was growing wary. He told Klyushin to knock it off. “Vlad, you are exposing our organization. This is bad,” he wrote. “That’s how they get you and you end up as a defendant in a court room.” A month later, former US Marine Trevor Reed was taken to jail in Moscow and sent to a state psychiatric facility. “There’s blood all over the walls where prisoners had killed themselves or killed other prisoners,” he later told CNN. “The toilet is just a hole in the floor and there’s, you know, crap everywhere, all over the floor, on the walls. There’s people in there that walk around, they look like zombies.” A similarly nightmarish story had recently unfolded for Paul Whelan, another former US Marine. He had gone to Russia for the wedding of a buddy when FSB agents burst into his hotel room and accused him of espionage. He was sent to a gulag that housed World War II prisoners and was given a job sewing buttons on winter uniforms. Cold showers were allowed, once a week. Meals consisted of “bread, tea, and a watery fish soup that seemed better suited as cat food,” according to The New York Times. Reed and Whelan were two of four US citizens arrested by Russian authorities during Trump’s first term, all on what appeared to be the flimsiest of pretenses. The Kremlin made it clear to the White House that some or all of the Americans would be let go—if the US government gave up some notorious Russian criminals in return. Moscow and Washington had been exchanging captured spies for six decades, off and on. This was something different. This had all the hallmarks of a ransom operation. The SEC, meanwhile, was picking up hints that a group of Russians was engaged in awfully strange stock sales—transactions that sure looked like insider trading. It wasn’t long before the FBI was looped in. Special agent B. J. Kang took the case. Best known for spearheading the probe that inspired Klyushin’s beloved show, Billions, Kang was already working on another insider trading investigation with two prosecutors at the US Attorney’s office in Massachusetts. Since this seemed like a similar-ish case, he brought them in. Seth Kosto had spent years trying insider trading and bank fraud cases. Stephen Frank, a former Wall Street Journal reporter, led the investigation into the “Varsity Blues” college admissions scandal. Together, the three dug in. Seeing the patterns—multiple trading accounts making parallel moves, the focus on quarterly earnings—the group quickly realized they were observing large-scale fraud. “And it was across industries and different kinds of companies,” Frank tells me. “The immediate thought we had was, ‘This is likely to be some sort of a hack.’” After further analysis of the market patterns, it became clear that the illicitly traded companies had something else in common: Their financial filings were all published by either Donnelley or Toppan Merrill. When investigators approached the two companies, executives didn’t believe they’d been hit. The companies launched internal investigations in which their own employees were scrutinized. The feds, meanwhile, conducted a series of “pen registers”—which reveal the connections between accounts, but not their contents—to try to figure out who in Russia was orchestrating the trades. They zeroed in on the duo from St. Petersburg. Mikhail Irzak claimed to be a marketer. According to public records, Igor Sladkov was a rather prolific entrepreneur, with his hand in restaurants, residential real estate, nonalcoholic beverages, and media buying. The investigators got a warrant to access Sladkov’s iCloud. Inside the account, they found a screenshot of a Snap Inc. announcement about upcoming company earnings—time-stamped from before it was released. It was textbook inside information. “So: smoking gun,” Frank says. “He was cooked.” When the feds examined Sladkov’s WhatsApp account, they saw that he had been communicating constantly with a figure well known to US law enforcement: the twice-indicted former intelligence officer Ivan Ermakov. “You come across someone who is alleged to have an immense hacking pedigree,” says Kosto. “All of a sudden, you have a path to explaining: How has this happened?” At 7:54 am Eastern time on November 6, 2019, the Julie Soma account at Donnelley downloaded a copy of Roku’s third-quarter financial results. The company was going to notably miss its targets. Everyone in M13’s orbit started shorting their Roku shares or trading other financial instruments based on Roku’s stock. As soon as the earnings came out, Roku’s price dropped from about $140 per share to less than $120. Klyushin and his investors cleared nearly $9 million in profits. Klyushin, though, was getting exhausted. “I am fucking tired rushing all the time. Need a rest,” he texted Ermakov. He consoled himself in Ermakov’s company—and a little retail therapy. Klyushin went apartment shopping with Ermakov, and bought himself a 78-foot, $4 million yacht from a shipyard in Cyprus. “At this point I want nothing except the boat,” Klyushin texted Ermakov in February 2020. “My pleasure is the boat and trading.” “Then you need nothing. Enjoy your life,” Ermakov responded. “I’ve read somewhere that if you keep buying while you have everything, it means you’re unhappy.” Klyushin answered, “Honestly I get a bigger kick when I check apartments for you, with you, the fact that we can walk home together and have a beer, or play golf, or simply send everyone to hell, knowing that you are close.” They didn’t know it at the time, but they had only a few months left together to trade. By then, Toppan Merrill had introduced two-factor authentication to its system, effectively locking the hackers out. Donnelley had cut off access to Julie Soma’s compromised account. Employees at Klyushin and Ermakov’s brokerage firm were getting suspicious too. In an April Skype call with an executive at Denmark-based Saxo Bank, Klyushin and another M13 employee asked for more banking privileges. The Saxo executive politely pushed back—and then asked why so many of Klyushin’s best trades seemed to happen right around the release of earnings’ reports. The M13 employee offered that it was the company’s media-monitoring prowess that gave them the edge. “It’s, ahem, first mass media. Second social media. And, uh, third, it’s, ahem, information investment sites,” the employee said. “We have an application,” Klyushin added, more smoothly, “which we are planning to launch onto the international market together with Swiss [investors], which in no way will be connected to the Russian Federation.” That way, M13 will be “open [to] investors from Europe and America.” If M13 really was developing a specialized program for traders, there’s scant evidence of it. But the idea of recruiting Western investors to trade on ill-gotten tips—that part was true. Klyushin and Ermakov were once photographed at a party with Anselm Schmucki, a Swiss citizen who ran the Russian office of DuLac Capital, a Zurich-based investment firm. “The goal was to offer this service to international clients—you know, whoever Anselm worked with,” Max Nemtsev, one of Klyushin’s lawyers, tells me. Schmucki declined to comment for this story. His former business partner, Domino Burki, insists their firm, DuLac, did nothing wrong. As for Schmucki himself—well, Burki can’t be so sure what went on in Moscow. “I just feel that Anselm is not a criminal,” he tells me. “He was a wheeler-dealer.” (In 2023, the UK foreign secretary and the US Treasury Department sanctioned Schmucki, with the latter claiming he worked with “a company with suspected links to Russian organized crime and money laundering.” The Treasury Department added, “Schmucki controls a global network of shell companies”—at least one of which was based in Edinburgh, Scotland—“and has had close financial relationships with an individual charged with financial crimes.”) Klyushin’s photo with Schmucki was just one of the hundreds of thousands of files that US prosecutors sifted through as investigators obtained warrants for the iCloud accounts of Ermakov, Klyushin, and the rest of the M13 operation. Other images grabbed their attention too: the screenshot of Ermakov trading with Klyushin’s account; the earnings reports, downloaded days before they became public; the small fleet of Porsche convertibles, like the one he drove in his wedding video; the encrypted chats that were backed up to Klyushin’s iCloud. This was enough evidence for an open-and-shut case, from Ermakov’s warning about ending up in a “court room,” which proved criminal intent, to the specific dates, times, and prices of the trades made with stolen information. One other photo stood out: a Russian Medal of Honor, given to Klyushin on June 14, 2020, and signed by one “V. Putin.” The day after Klyushin got his medal, Paul Whelan, the former US Marine, found himself standing in a glass cage in a Moscow City Court, dressed in a blue-gray sweater. He held up a sign: “Sham trial! Meatball surgery!” referring to the manufactured espionage charges against him and the emergency hernia operation he had undergone weeks earlier. He implored then president Trump to save him. Two men in ski masks, plaid shirts, and holstered pistols stood by his side while the judge handed down his sentence: 16 years in a gulag turned labor camp. A month and a half later, Trevor Reed received his nine-year sentence and was also sent to a horrific facility. He refused to work. They locked him in solitary confinement and eventually took away his books. He went on hunger strike. After that, he told CNN, “I started to get sick. I really at that point was consistently sick until I left. I started to cough up blood, and I coughed up that blood for a period of about three and a half months every day, multiple times a day.” By the end of the summer, the M13 crew had stopped trading off of the Donnelley and Toppan Merrill data, and prosecutors had no way of getting to them while they were in Russia. The hope was that one of them would decide to travel to a place where the government was relatively friendly to the US. Whoever left first—Sladkov, Irzak, Ermakov, Klyushin, you name it—that’s who was getting cuffed; everyone else would become a coconspirator in an insider trading case of stunning scale. “There was no plan B,” Frank tells me. Ermakov, already under two US federal indictments, had the good sense to stay in Russia. Klyushin, on the other hand, really wanted to experience the thrill of heli-skiing again. And this time, he had to do it in the Alps. This time, he’d take his wife. They’d celebrate their anniversary. In the US, prosecutors began preparing their criminal complaint against Klyushin. The FBI reached out to Swiss authorities. On Sunday, March 21, 2021, Klyushin and his wife took off from Moscow in a private jet. “You’re literally holding your breath,” Frank told CNBC. The Klyushins landed about four hours later at Sion airport, in Switzerland. “He was actually in ski gear, getting off the plane ready to board a helicopter,” Frank said. “The Swiss agents were waiting for him. They swooped in.” This is the point in the story when things get a little murky, a little strange. Klyushin was taken to a jail in Sion in handcuffs and leg irons, according to the local press. He was kept in solitary confinement and held without bail. But “he was not afraid or anything. He was in quite a relaxed mood,” says Oliver Ciric, the Swiss lawyer who quickly signed on to Klyushin’s case. Ciric—a multilingual expert on Russian responses to Western sanctions, and, improbably, an honorary consul of the Republic of Vanuatu—told the press that his client was arrested only after he refused advances by British and American intelligence operatives, first in a bar in the south of France and later in Edinburgh, Scotland. The implication was that these alleged spies were trying to pump Klyushin for information about his Kremlin contacts—or recruit him as an agent. It wasn’t a crazy claim, given Klyushin’s proximity to the Putin administration. But Ciric had no evidence to back it up. On April 7, the Kremlin asked the Swiss to extradite Klyushin back to Moscow. The man was a wanted criminal, the Russians claimed, accused of wide-scale financial fraud. That was odd, given how much the Kremlin was paying Klyushin’s company. Stranger still was Klyushin’s willingness to go along with the extradition request, since he’d presumably have to face the infamously brutal Russian justice system. The American government asked for Klyushin to be sent to the US 12 days later. That request was granted in late June. Everyone involved agreed that the process was unusually quick—high-profile extradition cases can drag on for years. “It’s completely out of the standard procedures,” Ciric says. “This is something that we attribute to the pressures, political pressures.” In June of that year, at a lakeside villa near Geneva, Putin and US president Joe Biden discussed a potential prisoner swap. It was a topic long under discussion, through a number of channels—formal exchanges by diplomats, less formal discussions by a shifting network of outside lawyers and advocates. No agreements were reached that day. But the two countries opened up a new channel, this one between the CIA and its Kremlin counterparts. After a series of appeals, Klyushin was sent to the US in December and held at Plymouth County jail. A trial date was set for about a year later. For a case of this complexity, that, too, was awfully quick. In part, that’s because of an agreement between the Justice Department, Klyushin’s defense lawyers, and the presiding judge, Patti Saris. Each side, for their own reasons, wanted to downplay Klyushin’s contacts in Russian government and society. Saris, for her part, was worried that too much talk about these connections could be prejudicial to the jury. The prosecutors, according to Frank, wanted to “focus on the actual facts of the insider trading.” Klyushin’s American lawyers, meanwhile, did a 180 on the earlier defense of him, never mentioning the supposed approaches by Western intelligence or why those spy agencies might be interested in their client. So the trial never detailed who Klyushin’s investors were—folks like Aleksandr Borodaev and Boris Varshavskiy, the guy who won the Russian gold medal for mining. Nor did the trial lay out how many Russians benefited from the scheme. It neglected to mention that when Klyushin shared photographs with Ermakov in August 2019 of a safe filled with $3 million in $100 bills, that safe was located inside the Russian Ministry of Defense. The trial was over in 16 days. Klyushin was found guilty on all charges. Not that he seemed to care. In 2022, the American and Russian governments swapped two sets of prisoners. They traded Konstantin Yaro-shenko, a Russian drug smuggler, for Trevor Reed, and they swapped Viktor Bout, the weapons trader known as the “Merchant of Death,” for the American basketball player Brittney Griner. Bout was a real-life supervillain, fueling conflicts from Afghanistan to Angola. Yaroshenko had agreed to smuggle 8,800 pounds of cocaine. Griner, on the other hand, had been held for the better part of a year for possession of less than a gram of hash oil. Reed was falsely accused of hitting a Russian cop one time. Of course, everyone was happy to see wrongly detained American civilians let go. But what message did it send to Putin, that he could trade Bout’s freedom for Griner’s? Yaroshenko’s for Reed’s? Doug London, a 34-year veteran of the CIA, says that while the trade was politically popular, it may not have been in the US’s long-term interest. “Russia was emboldened by this,” he tells me. “They’re just going to take more hostages, and they’re just going to arrest more people.” Klyushin was convicted on Valentine’s Day, 2023. About six weeks later, on March 29, Russian authorities effectively kidnapped Evan Gershkovich, the Wall Street Journal reporter, and accused him of being a spy. A worldwide outcry ensued. So did talks to make a trade that could bring him home. Depending on whom you believe, Klyushin was frequently discussed as the negotiators met along their various tracks—or he wasn’t mentioned at all. The Russian oligarch Roman Abramovich was deeply involved, or had nothing whatsoever to do with any talks. The State Department was stitching an international coalition to free the next set of Western prisoners, or was spinning its wheels on the margins. The CIA was leading the talks on the American side, or, as one of 10 sources put it, merely “delivering the mail” for the Biden White House, which was calling all the shots. Making matters even more complex: Many of the 24 people who were eventually freed in August’s massive prisoner exchange had their own advocates, all trying to negotiate with governments and with one another. One American prisoner even had two sets of representatives, each of which shit-talked the other to me. The CIA and the White House declined to comment on the record for this story. The State Department—whose top official for hostage affairs is so far from camera-shy that he once starred on a reality show—declined, as well. But after speaking to my sources and reading through the various official leaks, a few common threads emerged. Putin’s top priority, by far, was to get back another one of his killers: a hit man named Vadim Krasikov, who was serving a life sentence for carrying out an assassination in Berlin. (According to Gershkovich, Putin’s Department for Counterintelligence Operations deliberately “used” him and Whelan as trade bait to secure the release of Krasikov.) The Germans were open to it, if some high-profile Russian dissidents were freed. The Russians would agree to that if more of their operatives were released, like that deep-undercover couple in Slovenia—and Klyushin. It’s not hard to see why; Klyushin was a key contractor for Putin’s propaganda chief, so valued he got a medal from the Russian president himself. Additional hints of Klyushin’s value emerged in the months following his conviction, if you knew where to look. Klyushin’s friends Borodaev and Varshavskiy, the mining types, were put on the US sanctions list as part of the effort to “curtail Russia’s ability to exploit the international financial system.” Then there’s the broad array of unnamed Russian nationals who benefited from the M13 operation, and the mysterious Russian government official whose safe Klyushin filled up with $100 bills. Take a half-step back, and it’s plain that M13’s hack-and-trade effort was part of an attempt to fund Moscow’s economy through the back door, despite every US effort to shut it. On July 31, 2024, an official Kremlin news service reported that Klyushin had suddenly gone missing from a US prison database, along with three other Russian nationals. Two of the Russians—a hacker and an electronics smuggler—were soon back behind bars. Klyushin and two others were loaded on a plane by men in baseball hats and balaclavas and were flown first to Ankara, then to Moscow. Meanwhile, Whelan, Gershkovich, and the other prisoners held in Russia were met in a tearful, triumphant scene at Joint Base Andrews in Maryland by family, colleagues, Biden, and Vice President Kamala Harris. “I had on clothes that I had worn in 2018 when I’d been arrested. You know, they hadn’t been washed. They were too big for me,” Whelan told CBS. “I waved at people that were waving at me, and then I gave the president a salute as the commander in chief.” Whelan continued. “I thanked him for getting us home.” Watching from afar, Frank admitted to feeling just the tiniest bit conflicted amid the rapture of seeing Whelan and Gershkovich, the best-known of the freed American prisoners, back on US soil. “I was a reporter, and to have a fellow reporter held hostage like that, it’s pretty horrendous. And so I think we were thrilled to have a role in creating the opportunity for him to come home. On the flip side of that, it’s a guy who’s actually a criminal”—Klyushin—“going free to get people out who are completely innocent. I think we were gratified that he spent three years in jail at least before he went back,” says Frank, who recently joined a business litigation firm. “But yeah, there’s obviously a little bit of a mix of emotion.” In the images of his arrival at Vnukovo Airport, in Moscow, the man Frank chased for the better part of three years looks exhausted, with deep circles under his eyes and his brown hair largely turned to gray. His 5 o’clock shadow is now well past 7:30. Wearing an open-collared khaki shirt and matching pants, Vladislav Klyushin descends the stairs stiffly. He waits for the undercover couple and their kids to receive flower bouquets. Then Klyushin shakes the hand of Vladimir Putin, who gives him a one-armed embrace.

TITLE: The 42 Best Shows on Netflix Right Now

This helps support our journalism. Learn more. Based on the real-world Corby toxic waste case, this four-part drama follows the decades-long battle for justice faced by the former steelworking English town, after widespread industrial pollution led to multiple children being born with physical disabilities. Centered largely on the lives of mothers Susan McIntyre (former Doctor Who star Jodie Whittaker), Tracey Taylor (Aimee Lou Wood), and Maggie Mahon (Claudia Jessie), Toxic Town fiercely explores how far the community had to go for justice and how low the people responsible would stoop to avoid culpability. A searing, powerful, heart-wrenching drama that will—and should—leave you absolutely furious at corporate greed. Originally an AMC+ show, both seasons of Pantheon are now available on Netflix. Good timing too, since its nightmarish scenario of digitally uploaded human consciousnesses and exploration of the impact such technology would have on society feels worryingly prescient. With plot threads weaving between isolated Maddie Kim, whose dead father may have been reborn as an “Uploaded Intelligence,” Caspian Keyes, a genius teenager whose entire life is a Truman Show–style lie, and Vinod Chanda, an engineer investigating UI, this hard sci-fi outing—based on the short fiction of Ken Liu—offers a dark examination of virtual immortality. A uniquely brilliant adult animated series. Cards on the table: A significant part of the appeal here is seeing the iconic Robert De Niro in his first major English-language TV role (he previously appeared in the Argentinian Nada, aka Nothing). He doesn't disappoint with his performance as former US president George Mullen—pulled out of retirement to oversee a commission investigating a colossal cyberattack that left thousands of Americans dead and the terrifying warning that "this will happen again"—commanding the screen with his trademark gravitas. Director Lesli Linka Glatter wrings great drama from the whodunit of it all (Russians? hackers? hedge fund bros?), but with Mullen handed unprecedented powers to track down the culprits, the real nail-biting moments come from its suddenly timely explorations of abuses of power. With a powerhouse cast that includes Angela Bassett, Lizzy Caplan, and Jesse Plemons, Zero Day is an engaging political thriller, and at six episodes it makes for a great binge-watch. Influencers have been known to hawk nonsense diets and spurious “wellness” regimens, but few have ever done it like Belle Gibson, the real-life Australian influencer who went as far as faking brain cancer for attention. And while she hailed alternative diets and whole foods for keeping her nonexistent illness at bay—launching an app and cookbook in the process—actual cancer sufferers paid the price for her extreme narcissism and greed. This dramatized limited series—“a true-ish story … based on a lie,” as Netflix puts it—makes for uncomfortably gripping viewing as it charts the rise and fall of Gibson (Kaitlyn Dever, with a flawless Aussie accent) and her rivalry with Milla Blake (Alycia Debnam-Cary), a fellow influencer and actual cancer patient. Better than doomscrolling reels on Instagram or TikTok, and a reminder that everyone should be a lot more skeptical of anything influencers are shilling on social media. Special agent Peter Sutherland (Gabriel Basso) is back, and the stakes have never been higher. While the first season of The Night Agent wove a compelling spy drama out of the idea of a mole at the heart of America's intelligence services, the newly arrived second season takes a more global approach—Sutherland hunts down a stolen chemical weapon project, drawing him back into the orbit of tech savant and sometime love interest Rose Larkin (Luciane Buchanan), while Iranian diplomatic aide Noor Taheri (Arienne Mandi) offers secrets to the CIA in return for asylum, and a deposed Eastern European dictator aims to manipulate everything from behind bars. Sure, the show’s mix of politics and spook work won’t surprise genre diehards, but it weaves together its many influences—and many more plot threads—into a supremely entertaining thriller. The four Takezawa sisters are close but have little in common. Eldest Tsunako (Rie Miyazawa) is already a widow; repressed Takiko (Yû Aoi) and rebellious Sakiko (Suzu Hirose) are always at each other's throats; and second-born Makiko (Machiko Ono) tries to balance keeping the peace with being a housewife and mother to her own two children. Yet when Takiko learns that their father Kotaro (Jun Kunimura) may have a second, secret, family, the sisters’ bonds are put to the test as they struggle to uncover the truth. Asura is far more than a turgid family drama—it's equal parts heartwarming and hilarious, capturing the complexities of the relationships between its quartet of protagonists. Keeping the 1970s setting of Kuniko Mukōda’s original novel allows Palme d’Or– winning director Hirokazu Kore-eda (Shoplifters) to craft a gorgeously shot period piece that still feels incredibly timely and modern. In the midst of the French Revolution, citizens rise up against a parasitic ruling class—but vampire hunter Richter Belmont and his magic-wielding allies Maria and Annette are more concerned with what's literally bleeding the people dry. The first season of this grisly adult animated series saw the team coming together to face the rise of a "Vampire Messiah" prophesied to devour the sun, but the new second season ratchets up the action as the heroes team with Alucard, son of Dracula, to try to restore light to the world. Let's just say the stakes (sorry) have never been higher. While Nocturne's second season has some closer links to the previous Castlevania animated series, it still works perfectly well on its own, delivering high quality animation, brilliant action, and a fantastic cast of characters to sink your teeth into (sorry, again). Taro Sakamoto used to be the worst of the worst, a hit man par excellence, his lethal skills making him a legendary figure in the criminal underworld. Then he fell in love, got married, and retired to run a convenience store with his wife Aoi and their daughter Hana. Unfortunately, he didn't exactly leave his old job on the best of terms, and now a cadre of killers are out for the billion yen bounty on his head. Luckily, Sakamoto's lost none of his skills—even though he has let himself go in other areas—but can he protect his family without breaking Aoi's strict “no killing” rule? Based on the manga by Yuto Suzuki, this comedy-action anime is a blast, and with a new episode each Saturday rather than Netflix's usual drop-it-all-at-once model, it's appointment viewing you won't want to miss. You know the drill—everyday teenager learns she has superpowers and is destined to fight the forces of darkness. Except Jentry Chau (voiced by Ali Wong) is not like any other teenage girl—she’s known about the supernatural her whole life (her uncontrollable fire powers were a giveaway) and spent a lifetime avoiding it. Sent to study in Korea for her own safety, Jentry is drawn back into the mystic world after being attacked in Seoul by a jiangshi named Ed (Bowen Yang). Brought back to her home in Texas by her great-aunt, Jentry has to survive not only the formidable mogui Mr. Cheng, who intends to drain her soul and powers, but the horrors of high school, culture shock, and the pain of her own past. Taking the “high school is hell” metaphor of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, adding a dash of Gravity Falls’ mystery, and rooting it all in Asian mythology, Jentry Chau vs the Underworld is one of Netflix’s freshest animated shows in years. Produced in Korea, Squid Game blends Hunger Games and Parasite with a battle-royal-style contest. Hundreds of desperate, broke people are recruited to a contest where they can win enough money to never need to worry about their debts again. All they have to do to win the ₩45.6 billion ($35.8 million) jackpot is complete six children’s games. But it’s not that simple: All the games have a twist, and very few people make it out alive. Squid Game is intense, brutal, and often very graphic, but it is also completely gripping. After the show became a cultural phenomenon in 2021, fans waited what felt like an eternity for another season. That second season finally dropped on December 26. A reformatted Fab Five return, ready to change the lives of 10 new heroes. Relocating to Las Vegas, the ninth season of Queer Eye sees Karamo, Tan, Antoni, Jonathan, and new host Jeremiah Brent—taking Bobby Berk's seat as the design whiz—helping a retired showgirl regain her sparkle, organizing a dream wedding for new parents, and, in possibly their strangest case yet, teaching a magic dragon to shed his scaly exterior. No, really. Netflix's most feel-good show. Take Selling Sunset and add a grisly tragicomic twist and you just about have No Good Deed. A dark comedy from Liz Feldman, creator of Dead to Me, this eight-part series starts with Lydia and Paul Morgan (Lisa Kudrow and Ray Romano) putting their gorgeous home on the market, and descends into darker territory as prospective buyers go to ever more desperate attempts to get their hands on the house, nosy neighbors interfere, and the grisly history of the house itself threatens to come to light. Buoyed by a stellar cast including Teyonah Parris, Abbi Jacobson, Luke Wilson, and Denis Leary, this is a glossy, witty, and possibly only slightly exaggerated take on the brutality of the Los Angeles property market. The latest show from comedy mastermind Michael Schur (The Good Place, Parks and Recreation, Brooklyn Nine-Nine), A Man on the Inside features Ted Danson as Charles Nieuwendyk, a retired engineering professor who's lost all direction since his wife passed. But when private investigator Julie Kovalenko (Lilah Richcreek Estrada) needs a man of his demographic to go undercover in a retirement community to investigate allegations of resident abuse, Charles may find an unlikely new lease on life—if he can figure out how to use his smartphone, that is. Reflecting on end-of-life realities as much as it plays up Charles' fish-out-of-water situation, it's a show that's equal parts poignant, melancholic, and achingly funny—and it's based on a true story, to boot. Helen Webb (Keira Knightley) is wife to the UK defense secretary, mother to two children, and bored with her picture-perfect life. Spectacular cover then, since she's actually a spy for the mercenary organization Black Doves, selling state secrets to the highest bidder. But when her real love Jason (Andrew Koji) is killed, Helen is determined to find out who killed him and why—and her pursuit of the truth threatens both her public and private lives. Paired with assassin and old friend Sam (Ben Whishaw, in a very different spy role to his turn in the James Bond films) at the behest of stern operator Mrs. Reed (Sarah Lancashire), Helen's obsession could have led to a dour, gritty thriller, but Black Doves bucks the grim-dark trend to serve up a pulpy, colorful outing with enough heart to balance its violence. At only six episodes (with a second season already confirmed), it's a brisk watch too. Animated series based on video games can run the gamut from cheap cash-ins to half-decent if forgettable tie-ins, inaccessible to anyone but hardcore devotees. Yet Arcane stood out by making its connections to Riot Games' League of Legends almost optional. While its central figures, orphaned sisters Vi and Jinx, are playable characters in the game, this steampunk saga of class war, civil uprising, and the people caught in between is entirely accessible. The second and final season, released in a trio of movie-length blocks of three episodes apiece, escalates the conflict between the warring factions but never loses its central focus on the fractured relationship between sisters. With a gorgeous painterly art style, strong characters, and frequently shocking story beats, Arcane is one of the best animated series in years—and it has racked up plenty of awards, including a Primetime Emmy for Outstanding Animated Program, to prove it. Picking up decades after Daniel LaRusso and Johnny Lawrence’s iconic fight at the end of the first Karate Kid movie, Cobra Kai initially follows a washed-up Johnny as he reopens the Cobra Kai karate dojo, finding new purpose after defending his young neighbor Miguel (Xolo Maridueña, Blue Beetle) in a fight. Over the course of six seasons, the stakes get higher—and frankly, increasingly, gloriously, ludicrous—as rival martial arts schools start cropping up all over California. Alliances are forged and broken with alarming regularity, and everything gears toward a global battle for karate supremacy. It’s all a little bit tongue-in-cheek, and with Ralph Macchio and William Zabka reprising their 1980s roles, the show is an unabashed love letter to the classic action flicks, but thanks to some seriously impressive fights and stunt work, it’s a retro-styled delight. If there's a West Wing-shaped hole in your life, look no further than The Diplomat—a tense geopolitical thriller elevated by a superb central performance by The Americans' Keri Russell as Kate Wyler, newly appointed US ambassador to the UK. Far from being an easy assignment in a friendly country, Kate's role coincides with an attack on a British aircraft carrier, leaving her to defuse an international crisis while also navigating her fraying "special relationship" with husband Hal (Rufus Sewell). The second season picks up from a literally explosive cliffhanger and propels Kate into a political conspiracy—and a potential promotion to vice president. Some of the twists along the way are faintly ridiculous, but The Diplomat has become one of Netflix's biggest hits in recent years, and a third season is already in the works. Stop us if you've heard this one before: An agnostic sex podcaster and a Rabbi walk into a party … OK, it's not quite a setup for a joke, but rather for a sharp romcom—one based, in exaggerated form, on creator Erin Foster's own experiences. Joanne (Kristen Bell, The Good Place) is cynical and burned out on modern dating, even as it provides her material for the increasingly successful podcast she hosts with her sister Morgan (Justine Lupe). When she meets young, handsome Noah (Adam Brody, The OC), the attraction is instant and mutual—except he's just broken up with the stereotypical Nice Jewish Girl™ his family expected him to settle down with. Yet as the pair swirl through each other's lives, the show proves it's less about culture clash than it is exploring what the seemingly mismatched pair are willing to change and sacrifice to make their burgeoning relationship work. With sizzling chemistry between its leads, Nobody Wants This is a romcom with an emphasis on the romance. One of the most joyful shows on Netflix returns for another school year of teen drama and heartfelt queer romance. In the long-awaited third season, things heat up between the central couple, with Charlie (Joe Locke) preparing to say three little words to Nick (Kit Connor) for the first time, while Elle (Yasmin Finney) and Tao (William Gao) try to have the perfect romantic summer before Elle starts art college. Heartstopper's return also sheds some of its earlier cloying tendencies, growing up alongside its talented young cast and giving them more serious material to work with, tackling more mature themes of sex, eating disorders, and gender dysphoria—all without losing the warmth and charm that made audiences fall in love with the show in the first place. The show younger LGBTQ+ viewers need now, older ones needed years ago, and one that everyone needs to watch, whatever their sexuality. Stalking is no laughing matter, which makes this dramatized—and highly controversial—retelling of Scottish comedian Richard Gadd's own real-life experiences more than a little uncomfortable. Adapted from Gadd's one-man stage show of the same name, Baby Reindeer follows Donny (Gadd, playing a fictionalized version of himself) after he meets Martha (Jessica Gunning) at the pub he works at. Despite claiming to be a lawyer, Martha can't afford a drink—and a sympathetic gesture on Donny's part opens the door to increasingly obsessive and dangerous behavior as she proceeds to infiltrate his life. It's shockingly honest and self-aware in places—does Donny, and by extension Gadd, on some level relish the attention of his stalker? Are his occasional moments of kindness and warmth toward Martha inviting her further in? Is he using her, finding her a strange source of material for his stand-up career? A fiercely paced seven episodes, shot more like a horror movie, this Emmy-winning miniseries explores trauma and intimacy, shame and masculinity, and how society often silences the victims of abuse. "Anyone can fall in love with anyone" is the opening narration to The Boyfriend, Japan's first same-sex dating show—a bold and progressive statement that reflects the shifting tide of opinion in the country. Throwing nine single men together in an idyllic beach house for a summer and charging them with running a coffee truck, the over-arching concept is to see who'll pair up, but the series is as interested in exploring the friendships that emerge between the cast as it is the romantic relationships. Unlike Western dating shows, there are no scandals, no dramatic twists, no betrayals, and the “challenges” are adorably focused on confessing feelings. The gentleness of it all adds an almost relaxing quality, with the men discussing their emotions—and the nature of being queer in Japan—earnestly. An absolutely joyful example of reality TV. If you’re pining for more Killing Eve, then this German thriller may be the next best thing. Set in the late 1980s and early 1990s, the series follows the eponymous Kleo (Jella Haase), a Stasi assassin imprisoned by her agency on false treason charges. Released after the fall of the Berlin Wall, she seeks revenge on her former handlers—but West German detective Sven (Dimitrij Schaad), the only witness to her last kill, may have something to say about that. As dark and violent as you'd expect given the period and the themes of betrayal and vengeance, Kleo is lightened by its oft-deranged sense of humor and a charismatic lead duo who brilliantly bounce off one another—chemistry that's only heightened in the second season as Kleo's pursuit of her old allies intensifies, attracting attention from international spy agencies in the aftermath of the Cold War. Based on the Korean webcomic by Kim Carnby and Hwang Young-chan, Sweet Home offers a very different vision of apocalyptic end times—rather than pandemics, disasters, or even zombies, this posits an end of the world brought about by people's transformation into grotesque monsters, each unique and seemingly based on their deepest desires when they were human. The first season is a masterclass in claustrophobic horror, as the residents of an isolated, run-down apartment building—chiefly suicidal teen Cha Hyun-su (Song Kang), former firefighter Seo Yi-kyung (Lee Si-young), and Pyeon Sang-wook (Lee Jin-wook), who may be a brutal gangster—battle for survival. The second and third seasons explore what remains of the wider world, delving into the true nature of both monster and man—and if there's any hope for what remains of humanity. With phenomenal effects work blending prosthetics, CGI, and even stop-motion animation for some disturbingly juddering creatures, this stands apart from the horror crowd. Paramount+'s loss remains Netflix's gain, as the streamer's license rescue of this great Star Trek spin-off warps into its second season. After escaping a distant prison planet and becoming Starfleet cadets under the watchful eye of Star Trek Voyager's Admiral Janeway (voiced by the venerable Kate Mulgrew), the ragtag crew—led by aspiring captain Dal R'El and bolstered by astrolinguist Gwyndala, engineer Jankom Pog, energy being Zero, scientist Rok-Tahk, and indestructible, gelatinous Murf—find themselves cast through time on the most dangerous mission of their young lives. While aimed at younger audiences and intended as an intro to the wider Trek universe and its ethics, Prodigy packs in plenty for older Trekkers to appreciate, particularly with a slate of returning Star Trek legends voiced by their original actors. Prodigy is something of a sleeper hit, but one of the best Trek shows in years. One by one, five Black Londoners awaken to strange superpowers. Struggling father Andre (Eric Kofi-Abrefa) develops superstrength, nurse Sabrina (Nadine Mills) unleashes phenomenal telekinetic might, drug dealer Rodney (Calvin Demba) races at superspeed, and wannabe gang leader Tazer (Josh Tedeku) turns invisible. But it's Michael (Tosin Cole, Doctor Who) who may be the most pivotal, realizing he can leap through time and space and learning he only has three months to save his fiancée's life. Created by Andrew “Rapman” Onwubolu, Supacell is a show about superpowers, but not necessarily superheroes, with its fantastic cast offering up a far more realistic and human exploration of now-familiar ideas than anything you'll find in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. And the mystery of why—and how—only Black people seem to be gaining powers builds up to a more powerful punch than an Asgardian god of thunder. A smart, modern, and refreshing take on the genre. After suffering an improbable and humiliating death, Eleanor (Kristen Bell) finds herself in “The Good Place,” a perfect neighborhood inhabited by the world's worthiest people. The only problem? She's not meant to be there. Desperate to not be sent to “The Bad Place,” she tries to correct her behavior in the afterlife, with the help of her assigned soulmate, philosophy professor Chidi (William Jackson Harper). A twist at the end of the first season remains one of the best ever, while the show's ability to sprinkle ethical and philosophical precepts into a sitcom format is frankly astounding. With a sensational cast rounded out by Manny Jacinto, Jameela Jamil, D'Arcy Carden, and Ted Danson, The Good Place more than earns its place in the good place of TV history. Still ranking as one of Netflix’s most-watched series ever, Bridgerton is set during the Regency period in England and follows the powerful Bridgerton family as they navigate love, marriage, and scandal—with most of the latter stirred up by the gossip columns penned by the anonymous Lady Whistledown. Created for screen by Chris Van Dusen and executive produced by Shonda Rhimes, this incredibly bingeable and shockingly entertaining show is based on a series of novels by Julia Quinn, with each season focusing on a different branch of the Bridgerton tree. The third and latest season sees the spotlight fall on the long-simmering relationship between wallflower Penelope Featherington (Nicola Coughlan) and Colin Bridgerton (Luke Newton), a pairing that threatens to reveal powerful secrets that have been bubbling away since the very first episode. In 1960s China, at the height of the Cultural Revolution, gifted scholar Wenjie Ye witnesses her physicist father being beaten to death for his research, only for her to be recruited to a secret project relying on that same knowledge. Fast-forward to the present day, and physics is broken: Particle accelerators around the world are delivering impossible data, while scientists are being plagued by countdowns only they can see. Meanwhile, strange VR headsets appear to be transporting players to an entirely different world—and humanity’s continued existence may rely on there being no “game over.” Game of Thrones’ creators D. B. Weiss and David Benioff and True Blood executive producer Alexander Woo reimagine Chinese author Cixin Liu’s acclaimed hard sci-fi trilogy of first contact and looming interplanetary conflict as a more global affair. Wildly ambitious, and boasting an international cast featuring the likes of Benedict Wong, Rosalind Chao, Eiza González, and GOT alum John Bradley, Netflix's 3 Body Problem serves up the opening salvo in a richly detailed and staggeringly complex saga. Perhaps best known nowadays from 1999’s The Talented Mr. Ripley starring Matt Damon, novelist Patricia Highsmith’s inveterate criminal Tom Ripley has a longer, darker legacy in print and on the screen. For this limited series, creator Steven Zaillian goes back to Highsmith's original text, presenting Ridley (a never-more-sinister Andrew Scott of All of Us Strangers) as a down-on-his-luck con man in 1950s New York who is recruited by a wealthy shipbuilder to travel to Italy and persuade the businessman’s spoiled son Dickie Greenleaf (Johnny Flynn) to return home. But once in Italy, Ripley finds himself enamored with Dickie's lavish lifestyle—and will do anything to take it for himself. Shot in black and white to really sell its noir credentials, this is an instant contender for the finest interpretation of Highsmith's works to date. A talented young cast bring to life the tale of Aang (Gordon Cormier), the latest in a long line of avatars who can control all four cardinal elements, but is frozen in time for a century when his world needed him most. Awakened by new friends Katara (Kiawentiio) and Sokka (Ian Ousley), he sets about continuing his training as the Avatar in an attempt to restore balance, all the while pursued by the relentless Prince Zuko (Dallas Liu), heir to the imperialist Fire Nation that has conquered the world. Consider this a cautious recommendation—the original animated version, also on Netflix, remains superior—but Netflix's live action Avatar remake serves up scale and spectacle, without betraying the heart of the classic show. It's also already confirmed for two more seasons, so viewers can look forward to the complete saga without the now-familiar Netflix cancellation worries. If you're still not sold on the live-action Avatar, this sequel to the original series is well worth your time. Set 70 years after the animated Avatar: The Last Airbender, The Legend of Korra explores how Aang's world has progressed after decades of relative peace. When Korra, the new Avatar, moves to Republic City to complete her training under the tutelage of Tenzin—Aang's son, now with a family of his own—she finds herself and new friends Mako and Bolin caught in the growing tensions between element benders and the Equalist movement, who claim the unpowered are an oppressed class. As the series progresses over its four seasons, The Legend of Korra proves itself a very different beast than its predecessor, exploring political themes and social prejudices in deeper—and often darker—detail, while also expanding the more fantastic elements of the universe and revealing the origins of the first Avatar. Even more brilliantly animated, and with a unique 1920s inspired aesthetic, Korra is a show that grew up alongside its audience, and is all the stronger for it. Ever been cut off in traffic? Ever had it happen when you’re having a really bad day? Ever just wanted to take the low road, chase the person down and make them pay?! Then—after a few deep breaths—Beef is the show for you. It's a pressure valve for every petty grievance you’ve ever suffered, following rich Amy (Ali Wong) and struggling Danny (Steven Yeun) as they escalate a road rage encounter into a vengeance-fueled quest to destroy the other. Yet Beef is more than a city-wide revenge thriller—it's a biting look at how crushing modern life can be, particularly in its LA setting, where extravagant wealth brushes up against inescapable poverty and seemingly no one is truly happy. Part dramedy, part therapy, Beef is a bad example of conflict resolution but a cathartic binge watch that clearly resonates—as evidenced by its growing clutch of awards, including the Golden Globe for Best Limited Series. Something of a sleeper hit for years—its first two seasons debuted on AT&T's now-defunct pay TV channel Audience in 2017, before its third season appeared over on Amazon—all three seasons of this bleak comedy are now available on Netflix. Ron Livingston stars as Sam Loudermilk, a vitriolic former music critic and recovering alcoholic who proves almost pathologically incapable of holding his tongue when faced with life's small frustrations—a personality type possibly ill-suited to leading others through addiction support groups. It's dark in places, and its central character is deliberately unlikeable, but smart writing and smarter performances shape this into something of an acerbic anti-Frasier. Adapted from the beloved graphic novel series by Bryan Lee O'Malley, animated by one of the most exciting and dynamic studios in Japan, and voiced by the entire returning cast of director Edgar Wright's 2010 live-action adaption, Scott Pilgrim Takes Off would have been cult gold even if it was a straight retelling of its eponymous slacker's battles against lover Ramona Flowers' seven evil exes. Yet somehow, in a world devoid of surprises, this packs in killer twists from the very first episode, making for a show that's as fresh and exciting as ever. Saying anything else would ruin it—just watch. Think you know Astro Boy? Think again. In 2003, Naoki Urasawa (Monster, 20th Century Boys) updated original creator Osamu Tezuka's hugely influential "The Greatest Robot on Earth" story arc for his manga Pluto, opting for a more adult approach. The focus shifts from the heroic boy robot to grizzled cybernetic detective Gesicht as he investigates a series of murders of both humans and robots, each victim left with makeshift horns crammed into their heads. Meanwhile, Atom (Astro's Japanese name) is recast as a former peace ambassador, effectively a propaganda tool rolled out at the end of the 39th Central Asian War, still dealing with trauma from the experience. This adaptation is not only a faithful recreation of Urasawa's retelling, but is stunningly animated to a standard rarely seen in Netflix's original anime productions. With eight episodes, each around an hour long, this is as prestigious as any live-action thriller the streamer has produced, and a testament to both Tezuka and Urasawa's respective geniuses. In the 17th Century, Japan enforced its "sakoku" isolationist foreign policy, effectively closing itself off from the world. Foreigners were few and far between—so when Mizu (voiced by Maya Erskine) is born with blue eyes, nine months after her mother was assaulted by one of the four white men in the country, it marks her as an outsider, regarded as less than human. Years later, after being trained by a blind sword master and now masquerading as a man, Mizu hunts down those four men, knowing that killing them all is the only way to guarantee her vengeance. Exquisitely animated—which makes its unabashed violence all the more graphic—and with a phenomenal voice cast bolstered by the likes of George Takei, Brenda Song, Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa, and Kenneth Branagh, Blue Eye Samurai is one of the best adults-only animated series on Netflix. Netflix: License one of Japan’s best SF dramas in years. Also Netflix: Do nothing, literally nothing, to promote it, not even create an English subbed trailer. Which is where WIRED comes in—Pending Train is a show you (and Netflix) shouldn’t sleep on. When a train carriage is mysteriously transported into a post-apocalyptic future, the disparate passengers’ first concern is simply survival. Between exploring their new surroundings and clashing with people from another stranded train car over scarce resources, one group—including hairdresser Naoya, firefighter Yuto, and teacher Sae—begins to realize that there may be a reason they’ve been catapulted through time: a chance to go back and avert the disaster that ruined the world. A tense, 10-episode journey, Pending Train offers a Japanese twist on Lost, but one with tighter pacing and showrunners who actually have a clue where they want the story to go. Mark one up for persistence: After numerous anime adaptations ranging from “awful” to “not too bad,” Netflix finally strikes gold with its live-action take on the global phenomenon One Piece. Despite fans’ fears, this spectacularly captures the charm, optimism, and glorious weirdness of Eiichiro Oda’s beloved manga, manifesting a fantasy world where people brandish outlandish powers and hunt for a legendary treasure in an Age of Piracy almost verbatim from the page. The perfectly cast Iñaki Godoy stars as Monkey D. Luffy, would-be King of the Pirates, bringing an almost elastic innate physicality to the role that brilliantly matches the characters rubber-based stretching powers, while the crew Luffy gathers over this first season—including swordsmaster Roronoa Zoro (Mackenyu), navigator and skilled thief Nami (Emily Rudd), sharpshooter Usopp (Jacob Romero Gibson), and martial artist chef Sanji (Taz Skylar)—all brilliantly embody their characters. A lot could have gone wrong bringing One Piece to life, but this is a voyage well worth taking. Based on the comic American Jesus by writer Mark Millar (Kick-Ass, Kingsman) and artist Peter Gross (Lucifer), The Chosen One follows 12-year-old Jodie (Bobby Luhnow), raised in Mexico by his mother Sarah (Dianna Agron). While the young boy would rather hang out with his friends, his life—and potentially the world—changes forever when he starts exhibiting miraculous powers, attracting dangerous attention from sinister forces. While this could have been yet another formulaic entry in Netflix's expansive library of supernatural teen dramas (the Stranger Things vibe is particularly strong), the decision to shoot on film and in a 4:3 aspect ratio make this a visual delight, unlike almost anything else on the streamer at present. There's an English dub, but stick to the original Spanish with English subs for a better viewing experience. (Confusingly, there's another show with the exact same title on Netflix, a 2019 Brazilian series following a trio of relief doctors in a village dominated by a cult leader—also worth a watch, but don't get them confused!) When slacker Ryohei Arisu (Kento Yamazaki) is mysteriously transported to a deserted Tokyo, his keen gaming skills give him an edge navigating a series of lethal games that test intellect as much as physical prowess. Yet after barely scraping through several rounds, Arisu is no closer to uncovering the secrets of this strange borderland, or to finding a way home—and the stakes are about to get even higher. Not only are Arisu and his allies Usagi (Tao Tsuchiya), Kuina (Aya Asahina), and Chishiya (Nijiro Murakami) faced with another gauntlet of sadistic games, but they find themselves caught between rival card suit “courts” vying for power—and not everyone can be trusted. With its willingness to kill off main characters at a moment’s notice, the first season of this gripping adaptation of Haro Aso’s manga kept viewers on tenterhooks throughout. As the long-awaited second season leans further into its twisted Alice in Wonderland imagery, expect more shocking developments in this taut thriller. In Russian Doll, Nadia has one very big problem: Time keeps breaking around her. Season one finds Nadia—played by Natasha Lyonne, who is also a cocreator on the show—dying at her own birthday party, only to wake up there over and over again, trapped in a Groundhog Day-style loop until she can unravel her personalized knot in the space-time continuum. Things only get stranger in season two, where Nadia finds herself traveling back in time to 1982 and inhabiting the body of her own mother—currently heavily pregnant with Nadia herself. Both seasons are funny and thought-provoking, reflecting on personal and generational trauma, all without overegging the potential for philosophical musing. Arsène Lupin, the belle epoque burglar created by French novelist Maurice Leblanc in the early 1900s, is reinvented as Assane Diop, a first-generation Frenchman with a mania for Lupin books and a grudge against the powerful forces who decades ago framed his father for a theft he didn’t commit—and led him to die in prison. Pairing drones, social media bots, and hacking skills with traditional tools of the trade like fake beards, picklocks, and quick wits, Diop hunts down his adversaries as he searches for the truth about his father’s fate. In his spare time, Diop also tries to patch together a crumbling marriage and build a better rapport with his son. Worth watching in the French original, this five-episode series’ strength lies in the dialog, the character development, and the charismatic performance of Omar Sy as Assane. The actual escapades and daring heists are beautifully choreographed, but a lot of the mechanics—how a certain piece of legerdemain worked, when an impenetrable building was infiltrated—are left to the viewer's imagination.

TITLE: The DOJ Still Wants Google to Sell Off Chrome
DATE: Mar 7, 2025 6:26 PM
CONTENT:
The US Department of Justice wants Google to sell off its Chrome browser as part of its final remedy proposal in a landmark antitrust case. The proposal, filed Friday afternoon, says that Google must “promptly and fully divest Chrome, along with any assets or services necessary to successfully complete the divestiture, to a buyer approved by the Plaintiffs in their sole discretion, subject to terms that the Court and Plaintiffs approve.” It also would require Google to stop paying partners for preferential treatment of its search engine. The DOJ also demands that Google provide prior notification of any new joint venture, collaboration, or partnership with any company that competes with Google in search or in search text ads. However, the company no longer has to divest its artificial intelligence investments, which was part of an initial set of recommendations issued by the plaintiffs last November. The company would still be required to give prior notification of future AI investments. “Through its sheer size and unrestricted power, Google has robbed consumers and businesses of a fundamental promise owed to the public—their right to choose among competing services,” the DOJ statement accompanying the filing claims. “Google’s illegal conduct has created an economic goliath, one that wreaks havoc over the marketplace to ensure that—no matter what occurs—Google always wins.” The DOJ formally brought its case against Google back in 2020, the most significant tech antitrust case since the DOJ’s years-long battle against Microsoft in the 1990s. The lawsuit alleged that Google has used anticompetitive tactics to protect its search dominance and forge contracts that ensure it’s the default search engine on web browsers and smartphones. Because of its hold on search, the lawsuit claimed, Google can adjust the auction system through which it sells ads and increase prices for advertisers, and rake in more revenue from that. Google has argued that its overwhelming success in search—it has a nearly 90 percent share in the US market—stems from the company offering the best search technology. It also says consumers are easily able to change their default search engine, and that Google does face competition from Microsoft and others. “DOJ’s sweeping proposals continue to go miles beyond the court’s decision, and would harm America’s consumers, economy and national security,” said Google spokesperson Peter Schottenfels in an emailed statement. The case went to trial in 2023, and in August 2024 the US district judge for the District of Columbia, Amit Mehta, ruled that Google has maintained an illegal monopoly, both in general search and general search text ads. Much of the ruling centered on the contracts Google has with device makers and browser partners, which use Google as their default search technology. According to Mehta’s ruling, around 70 percent of search queries in the US happen through portals in which Google is the default search engine. Google then shares revenues with those partners, paying out billions of dollars to them, which disincentivizes smaller search rivals who can’t compete with those contracts, Mehta said. This past November, government attorneys submitted a detailed plan to Mehta that included a spate of recommendations for how to best loosen Google’s stronghold on the US search market. These recommendations included that Google promptly divest Chrome, its popular web browser; possibly divest Android; end its search partnership with Apple, in which Apple receives billions of dollars each year for its Safari browser to default to Google search; and give competitors access to Google’s data, for both search and ads, “that would otherwise provide Google an ongoing advantage from its exclusionary conduct.” Kent Walker, Google’s president of global affairs and its chief legal officer, called the November proposal a “radical interventionist agenda” that would “endanger the security and privacy of millions of Americans” and stifle innovation. Walker said it would also “chill our investment in artificial intelligence, perhaps the most important innovation of our time, where Google plays a leading role.” Google has increasingly featured AI-powered results at the top of its search pages, despite sometimes uneven results. In a counter-proposal filed by Google in December, the company said it would structure its contracts to allow for multiple default search agreements across different devices, so that Apple’s iPhones and iPads might have different default search engines; change the length of its search revenue deals with hardware manufacturers to one year rather than locking them into long-term agreements; and allow more flexibility around search and Chrome for Android phone makers. It emphasized that its revenue partners, like Apple and Mozilla, “have the freedom to do deals with whatever search engine they think is best for their users.” Essentially, Google has suggested that the company is willing to reevaluate its contracts with partners, but has argued—citing earlier antitrust cases as precedent—that it shouldn’t have to divest parts of its business, share its secret sauce with competitors, or restrict its investments in search and AI, all of which, it argues, would dampen innovation. Today’s official remedy is notable in that it reinforces calls for a breakup of part of Google’s core business. For Google, it’s an opening salvo to what will likely be a years-long appeal process. Google has already said it plans to appeal whatever remedy is issued; arguments for the two proposals are scheduled for April in Mehta’s court. The remedy will also mark the first major outcome of a US antitrust case under the new Trump administration. Paul Swanson, a litigation partner at Holland & Hart LLP in Denver, Colorado, who focuses on technology and antitrust, says the government’s remedies may be part of a “maximalist opening position that they can then negotiate from.” “The one through-line here is that this administration wants to be perceived as being tough on tech, but also not slow the growth of America’s tech industries,” Swanson says. “So they may signal more action than what they ultimately want.” Update 3/7/25 and 6:44pm ET: This story has been updated with a statement from Google.

TITLE: SpaceX’s Latest Starship Explosion Marks Two Consecutive Failures
DATE: Mar 7, 2025 11:00 PM
CONTENT:
SpaceX’s Starship launcher spun out of control minutes after liftoff Thursday, showering fiery debris over the Bahamas and dealing another setback to Elon Musk’s rocket program after a failure under similar circumstances less than two months ago. Starship and its Super Heavy booster, loaded with millions of pounds of methane and liquid oxygen propellants, lumbered off their launchpad in Texas at 5:30 pm Central time to begin the eighth full-scale test flight of SpaceX’s new-generation rocket. Thirty-three Raptor engines propelled the 404-foot-tall (123.1-meter) rocket through a clear afternoon sky with more than twice the power of NASA’s Saturn V rocket, the workhorse of the Apollo lunar program. Repeating a feat SpaceX accomplished with Starship twice before, the rocket’s Super Heavy booster separated from the Starship upper stage roughly two-and-a-half minutes into the flight, then guided itself back to the Texas coastline for a catch by mechanical arms on the launchpad’s tower. SpaceX is now 3-for-3 with attempts to catch a Super Heavy booster back at the launch site, a sign that engineers are well on their way to mastering how to recover and reuse boosters in a similar way as they do with the smaller workhorse Falcon 9 rocket.

But SpaceX is now 0-for-2 on test flights of the newest version of Starship, called Block 2 or Version 2. The first six Starship test flights used an initial version of the ship, but SpaceX is modernizing its fleet with Starship Block 2, which stands slightly taller than the first version in order to accommodate additional propellants. Starship Block 2 also debuts smaller forward flaps to give the hardware another layer of protection from the scorching heat of reentry. The other notable change with Block 2 is a redesigned fuel-line system to feed propellants to the ship’s six Raptor engines. The good news is there are many more Starships under construction in South Texas, so SpaceX likely won’t have to wait long to try again. The company started the year aiming for as many as 25 Starship test flights in 2025 but will end the first quarter of the year with just two. “Today was a minor setback,” wrote Elon Musk, SpaceX’s CEO, on X. “Progress is measured by time. The next ship will be ready in 4 to 6 weeks.” SpaceX Starship Flight 8 launches from Orbital Launch Pad A at Boca Chica beach on March 06, 2025 in Boca Chica Beach, Texas. SpaceX has contracts with NASA worth approximately $4 billion to design and develop a human-rated Moon lander based on the Starship design. The Starship lander is a central piece of NASA’s architecture for the Artemis program, which aims to return astronauts to the lunar surface later this decade. For Starship to fly to the Moon, SpaceX must refill it with super-cold propellants in low-Earth orbit, something no one has done at this scale before. Musk sees Starship as the interplanetary backbone for transporting cargo and people to Mars, one of his most consistent long-term goals. This, too, requires orbital refueling. Musk recently suggested SpaceX could be ready to demonstrate ship-to-ship orbital refueling in 2026, a year later than the 2025 goal NASA officials discussed in December. Starship will also launch SpaceX’s next-generation Starlink Internet satellites. Before Thursday’s launch, ground crews loaded four Starlink mock-ups inside Starship’s payload bay to test the rocket’s deployment mechanism. Officials were eager to assess the performance of Starship Block 2’s heat shield before committing to an attempt to recover the ship intact (like SpaceX is already doing with the Super Heavy booster) on a future mission. But the premature ending of this test flight means those objectives must wait. SpaceX oversees Starship using an iterative development cycle. Engineers come up with new designs, rapidly test them, and then incorporate lessons learned into the next rocket. It’s not surprising to see a few rockets blow up using this spiral development cycle. But back-to-back failures, especially with so many similarities, may point to a more fundamental issue. The flight plan going into Thursday’s mission called for sending Starship on a journey halfway around the world from Texas, culminating in a controlled reentry over the Indian Ocean before splashing down northwest of Australia. The test flight was supposed to be a do-over of the previous Starship flight on January 16, when the rocket’s upper stage—itself known as Starship, or ship—succumbed to fires fueled by leaking propellants in its engine bay. Engineers determined the most likely cause of the propellant leak was a harmonic response several times stronger than predicted, suggesting the vibrations during the ship’s climb into space were in resonance with the vehicle’s natural frequency. This would have intensified the vibrations beyond the levels engineers expected. The Super Heavy booster returned to Starbase in Texas to be caught back at the launch pad. Engineers test-fired the Starship vehicle earlier this month for this week’s test flight, validating changes to propellant temperatures, operating thrust, and the ship’s fuel feed lines leading to its six Raptor engines. But engineers missed something. On Thursday, the Raptor engines began shutting down on Starship about eight minutes into the flight, and the rocket started tumbling 90 miles (146 kilometers) over the southeastern Gulf of Mexico. SpaceX ground controllers lost all contact with the rocket about nine-and-a-half minutes after liftoff. “Prior to the end of the ascent burn, an energetic event in the aft portion of Starship resulted in the loss of several Raptor engines,” SpaceX wrote on X. “This in turn led to a loss of attitude control and ultimately a loss of communications with Starship.” Just like in January, residents and tourists across the Florida peninsula, the Bahamas, and the Turks and Caicos islands shared videos of fiery debris trails appearing in the twilight sky. Air traffic controllers diverted or delayed dozens of commercial airline flights flying through the debris footprint, just as they did in response to the January incident. There were no immediate reports Thursday of any Starship wreckage falling over populated areas. In January, residents in Turks and Caicos recovered small debris fragments, including one piece that caused minor damage when it struck a car. The debris field from Thursday’s failed flight appeared to fall west of the areas where debris fell after Starship Flight 7. A spokesperson for the US Federal Aviation Administration said the regulatory agency will require SpaceX to perform an investigation into Thursday’s Starship failure.

Please also consider subscribing to WIRED Just after midnight on August 24, 1995, a student named Jonathan Prentice walked into a bookshop in Auckland, New Zealand, pulled out 200 New Zealand dollars, and became the first owner of Windows 95. Turning to a reporter, Prentice declared: "I will be able to play solitaire and send faxes at the same time." And with that rallying cry, the Windows 95 craze exploded. Lines formed around the world as consumers jostled to buy copies; journalists in Poland prepared to take a Microsoft-sponsored submarine ride under the Baltic Sea; The Times of London handed out free papers wrapped in a Windows ad; and the Empire State Building lit up in Windows' signature colors. Within a month, Microsoft's new operating system had sales of more than $250 million and Bill Gates went from being a nerd to ... well, he was still a nerd, but an invincible rock-star nerd. The future was very clear: PCs—running Microsoft software—would be the single most important device in our lives. Screw ups, disasters, misfires, flops. Why losing big can be a winning strategy. Accept Defeat: The Neuroscience of Screwing Up Stay in the Game: The Fall and Rise of Alec Baldwin Learn to Let Go: How Success Killed Duke Nukem In Silicon Valley, Larry Ellison followed the glowing press coverage and fumed. He had lived in Gates' shadow since March 1986, when Oracle, Ellison's database-software company, had gone public just a day before Microsoft. Gates got attention for everything he did, but barely anyone knew Oracle. Windows 95 was the last straw. "There was peace in the Middle East and war in Bosnia the same week," he later groused. "And all that the major networks seemed to cover was people in parking lots waiting up all night to get their first copy of Windows 95." His grudge wasn't just about ego; Microsoft had already begun nosing around the database-software industry, and its mounting war chest meant that it could easily fund a push into Oracle's territory. Immediately after the Windows 95 launch, Ellison called one of his lieutenants, Farzad Dibachi, to his mansion in Atherton, California. For years, Dibachi—who was responsible for brainstorming new business strategies—had urged Ellison to think more broadly about his company's potential. Now, the two discussed a vision for Oracle that would neutralize Microsoft's main advantage: the dominance of its operating system. They imagined a simple machine that would eschew software installed on a hard drive in favor of accessing applications online. Data—videos, documents, pictures—would be stored in Oracle databases instead of on the computer itself. In place of a robust operating system, this machine would work with programs and files through browsers like Netscape Navigator. Ellison liked the idea, and he and Dibachi started working on a speech so the CEO could share it with the world. The device would be called the network computer. It was a powerful idea, one that would enchant companies and analysts throughout the IT industry. But it would ultimately fail. In 1999, after spending four years and losing nearly $175 million, Oracle pulled the plug, changing the name of its network computer spinoff to Liberate Technologies and focusing its business on set-top box software for interactive television. (Ellison personally funded another network computer startup that didn't fare any better.) Journalists referred to the idea as "embarrassingly wrong." Gates called it "a fantasy." Even Ellison distanced himself from the debacle. (He declined to discuss it with Wired.) And yet, while his computer may have failed, Ellison's grand vision did not. Just as he predicted, a wave of cheap, underpowered computers with small hard drives and omnipresent Internet connections did challenge the traditional PC. Ellison's vision of widget-based online software has become conventional wisdom. The network computer failed as a product and as a business, but it seeded an idea—and a group of technologists—that would go on to remake the computing world. We typically think about failure in one of two ways: It's either something to avoid or something from which we can learn simple personal lessons about perseverance and character. Silicon Valley has long patted itself on the back for its acceptance—even promotion—of failure. By encouraging risk-taking, the tech industry allows bad ideas to get out of the way so good ones can take their place. But failure is not just the negative space surrounding success. Failures, too, can change the world—just as fundamentally as successes. They can serve as the necessary first round of innovation, the sacrificial lambs that bleed out an insight or vision or breakthrough before perishing. Everywhere you look, our world has been shaped fundamentally by failures. North American farmers in the early 1920s failed to cure their hay properly, causing an outbreak of internal hemorrhaging in cattle but eventually leading to the discovery of warfarin, an anticoagulant that has saved countless lives. Preston Tucker produced only 51 cars, but many of his ideas about safety prefigured the era of airbags and three-point seat belts. Xerox PARC invented the modern personal computer but was unable to capitalize on it, letting others take the technology—from the graphical user interface to the word processor—in thousands of different directions. In a way, seen through a long enough lens, everything is eventually a failure. Every innovation will ultimately be usurped by something that does the same thing more cheaply or more effectively or more elegantly. Everything is failing all the time; it's just a matter of how quickly and how devastatingly. In his 1964 book, The Nature of Design, industrial designer David Pye attempted to lay to rest the very notion of success: "Nothing we design or make ever really works. We can always say what it ought to do, but that it never does," he wrote. "Everything we design and make is an improvisation, a lash-up, something inept and provisional." The network computer was the embodiment of that: It didn't work as promised, it was too early, and it cost too much. But looking back now, it's hard to see it as anything but a success. Ellison unleashed his concept on September 4, 1995, just days after he and Dibachi had come up with it. The setting was ironic: Ellison was serving as a warm-up act at International Data Corp.'s European IT Forum in Paris. The headliner? Bill Gates. Some of the analysts and techies in the room didn't even seem to know who Ellison was. It was a familiar if frustrating experience for the Oracle CEO; his company wasn't even close to being a household name. Ellison refused to be a second-stringer. "A PC is a ridiculous device," he said, launching an attack on Microsoft's core business. He ran down a list of the desktop's deficiencies: It was hard to learn to operate, expensive, overpowered, and—thanks to the arrival of the World Wide Web—increasingly irrelevant. That's why he was ushering in the post-PC era with the network computer, or NC, which Oracle would help build within a year. The simple $500 box would be a stripped-down unit that served one purpose: to connect to the Internet. For the NC, the Web wouldn't be a mere feature but a utility, as fundamental as water and electricity. "What the world really wants," Ellison told the crowd, "is to plug into a wall to get electronic power, and plug in to get data." Soon, software and hardware manufacturers around the world had signed on to help make Ellison's vision a reality. British computer maker Acorn began ferrying executives to California to discuss the possibility of an Acorn NC. IBM executive Bob Dies persuaded CEO Louis Gerstner to start building the bare-bones machines, eventually establishing a network computer division. "I explained to him that this could mean companies would not have to update every single desktop around their company," Dies says. "He saw the light quickly." Netscape cofounder Marc Andreessen declared the NC "a pretty major new business opportunity," predicting that hundreds of millions of the machines would be in homes and offices within 20 years. Frank Gens, an analyst at IDC, foretold a day when banks would give them away to attract new customers. "Once that happens, it becomes a completely different PC industry," he told BusinessWeek. "If I were Compaq, IBM, or Dell, I'd be thinking hard about that." Perhaps nobody was as excited as Eric Schmidt, CTO of Sun Microsystems. Within months, Sun built an NC prototype and began developing a lean operating system to run on it. Speaking to U.S. News & World Report, Schmidt couldn't stop raving about the idea's potential. Of course, the NC could greatly benefit his business: As the company responsible for the development of the Java programming language, which would power the Web applications, Sun and its work would gain new relevance. But the ramifications went way beyond Sun, he told the reporter. The NC would usher in a whole new world of computing, setting off a wave of innovation. "The implications are serious," he said. "If this takes off, it will have enormous impact." Consumers were just as captivated. Oracle executives received voicemails from strangers expressing interest in the machine. The company's salespeople fielded more questions about the NC than about the databases that constituted the bulk of Oracle's business. Internal support teams geared up to prepare for an onslaught of new customers once the rollout went global. In his attempt to take down a competitor, Ellison had stumbled upon a groundswell of pent-up demand. "The NC story just exploded beyond anything I imagined," Ellison said later. "It took on a life of its own." Obsessive competitiveness may have inspired Ellison's idea, but it also contributed to its downfall. His turf battle with Redmond ended up kneecapping his product. Looking to stem the momentum of Windows, Ellison promised to release low-cost machines within a year. That meant rushing out computers before they were fully developed. When it hit stores in the fall of 1996, the Acorn NC—commissioned by Oracle to be the model around which the new market would coalesce—had an underpowered ARM processor that produced blocky graphics and strained to render a Web page in less than four seconds. IBM's Network Station computers—the flagship corporate version of the NC—didn't fare much better. They were too slow, too limited, and too complicated to coordinate with company servers. Irving Wladawsky-Berger, who ran the Internet division at IBM and ultimately oversaw its NC project, was embarrassed. "We thought we had a full product," he says. "But when we took it to market, we realized it was an alpha." Oracle's rush to market also meant that the NC hit shelves before the infrastructure existed to support it. The machine was supposed to run lightweight Web applications instead of installed software—and everyone believed Java would be up to the task. But it was never able to support powerful-enough applications. And with wide-scale broadband penetration still many years away, Internet apps didn't stand a chance against local software. In the run-up to the release, Ellison's Ahab-like obsession with Microsoft fueled his need to be kept apprised of every development. Nonetheless, the globe-trotting CEO would often shift his focus to other projects, leaving his staff to make major decisions about the NC. ("Mr. Larry is near Australia in his sailboat and can't be reached," read one email from an Oracle employee to a member of the Acorn team. "The feeling on the staff here is that the case designs won't fly.") By 1999, the NC was basically dead. IBM had sold only 10,000 or so of its version and eventually shuttered its NC division; RCA had developed an NC as well, but it, too, sold only about 10,000, nearly all of which the company later recalled. Acorn imploded, and Netscape was crushed by Microsoft's Internet Explorer. Gates delivered his own, gloating coda in late 1998, speaking at the same Paris IT conference where Ellison had first announced the NC. "The network computer is pretty discredited," Gates told the crowd. In 1995, Larry Ellison began his network computer crusade. The effort failed, but the concept would spark what became cloud computing. —D.R. Network Computer: Low-cost boxes with tiny operating systems and read-only memory. Internet apps that are accessed via browser and dialup modem. Cloud Computing: Low-cost netbooks with low-cost operating systems. Internet apps that are accessed via browser and broadband connection. Network: Productivity tools and games that are run as applets written in the Java programming language. Downloaded from the Internet. Cloud: Productivity tools and games that are run as applets written using protocols like Ajax and Ruby on Rails. No downloads required. Network: Oracle, Sun, IBM, Netscape Cloud: Amazon.com, Google, Salesforce.com Network: Microsoft Cloud: None The NC offensive may have failed to create a new product category, but Ellison's primary motivation was not to sell millions of computers; he wanted to damage Microsoft while improving his own reputation. And by those standards, the NC was a rousing success. One of its main draws was price—for a fraction of the cost, NC customers would get everything they needed from a home computer. But almost immediately after the NC was announced, PC prices began to plummet, partially in response to Ellison's threat. From the 1970s to the early '90s, the cost of desktop PCs—adjusted for performance—dropped an average of 15 percent a year. Between 1995 and 2000—the NC era—PC prices fell at an annual rate of 28 percent. By the late '90s, consumers could get a full desktop computer for less than $800. For just a few hundred dollars more, the PC could do everything the NC could, and much more. This was bad news for the NC, but it was also bad news for Microsoft's main allies, the PC makers, who had to slash their margins to compete with the phantom product. Even more important, the NC initiative put Microsoft on the defensive. Instead of pushing into new areas—like Oracle's database-software business—the company was forced to safeguard its own business model. After initially downplaying the threat and importance of the Internet, Gates became obsessed. Rather than attacking Oracle, he went after Netscape in what became an all-consuming fight that nearly drove Microsoft to a government-imposed breakup. Oracle may have spent a ton of money on its NC gamble, but its now $112 billion database business never faced a serious threat from Redmond. All the excitement about the NC had also raised Oracle's profile. Ellison was no longer an also-ran; he was lauded as a seer and started getting the same kind of press adulation as Gates. In April 1995, Charlie Rose had Ellison on to talk about the Internet for just a few minutes—sandwiched between discussions of the O. J. Simpson trial and Pope John Paul II. By 1996, Rose had Ellison on as a featured guest. Soon after the NC failed, Ellison spoke with his biographer to revisit the initiative. All in all, he said, he had gotten what he wanted out of it. He was more famous and better respected than ever. He had brushed back Microsoft and established Oracle as a peer and formidable competitor. Sure, the NC itself never caught on, but Ellison didn't seem too concerned. He summed up the entire project in a typically blusterous quote: "As for the network computer, I don't care about it at all." But many of Ellison's cohorts weren't so quick to dismiss the NC vision. In the following years, they would continue to pursue it. And their efforts would change the computing landscape and ultimately fulfill Ellison's vision—whether he cared about it or not. In 1997, Eric Schmidt was lured away from Sun to take over ailing enterprise-software company Novell; four years later, he was brought on as CEO of Google. Yet he could never let go of the NC concept. In 2005, he noticed the emergence of Ajax, a technology that enabled Web-based applications to run as smoothly as their shrink-wrapped, locally installed counterparts. It enabled programmers to develop and deploy software in ways that Sun had only dreamed about when creating Java. Almost instantly, Google engineers began building software—most notably Google Docs and Spreadsheets, direct competitors to Microsoft's flagship Office suite. Last summer, Google announced an even more ambitious project: a lightweight operating system engineered to power inexpensive portable computers that lack hard drives. Called Chrome OS, the software is designed to be barely noticeable. Its sole function is to connect the device to the Web. Sound familiar? "I've been giving the same speech for 15 years," Schmidt says. "But ultimately, the reason the NC didn't work was that the technology wasn't mature enough." Now, he says, that's no longer true. "Chrome is the consequence of the network computer vision." In 1999, senior vice president Marc Benioff left Oracle to create Salesforce.com. Benioff had been enthralled by the idea of the computer as an "Internet terminal" since 1995, when Ellison discussed the notion with him on a trip to Beijing. Salesforce provided a Web-based alternative to bulky, installed enterprise software—programs that could run on an Internet terminal rather than a full-powered PC. As Salesforce grew more popular in the early 2000s, Benioff became more belligerent, even Ellisonian, in his description of the company's potential impact. He declared Salesforce to be the angel of death for the installed-software industry and ran an ad showing an F-22 emblazoned with "Salesforce.com" shooting down a biplane that had "software" inscribed on its wing. His cockiness would prove merited. Within the past few years, many of Salesforce's competitors—including such powerhouses as SAP and CA—have built their own cloud-based offerings, and cloud has become a Silicon Valley buzzword. (Ironically, Ellison has recently taken to bemoaning the popular but ill-defined term. "Maybe I'm an idiot," he told an Oracle conference in 2008, "but I have no idea what anyone is talking about.") Now that the Web-software environment has been established, NC-like hardware has begun to proliferate. The first example, of course, is netbooks. Debuting just two years ago, they currently account for more than 20 percent of PC sales. In the 12 months ending in September 2009, sales jumped 77 percent. Yet while the netbook may be the direct descendent of the NC, its cousin, the smartphone, is seen by most alumni of the NC movement as the more powerful force. Every day, iPhone and iPod users download 4.5 million applications—grown-up versions of the widgets that Ellison predicted would run on the NC. "Ellison is often time-dyslexic—right about the fundamental trend but wrong on timing, " says David Roux, a partner at private equity firm Silver Lake and a former Oracle executive vice president. "It's hard to look at a $299 netbook and not see the NC vision come to life." We tend to think of technology as a steady march, a progression of increasingly better mousetraps that succeed based on their merits. But in the end, evolution may provide a better model for how technological battles are won. One mutation does not, by itself, define progress. Instead, it creates another potential path for development, sparking additional changes and improvements until one finally breaks through and establishes a new organism. In his 1988 book, The Evolution of Technology, historian George Basalla argues that machines develop in the same way. "Only a few variants," he writes, "have the potential to start a new branching series that will greatly enrich the stream of made things, have an impact on human life, and become known as 'great inventions' or 'turning points in the history of technology.'" In October, Microsoft unveiled Windows 7, the latest version of its operating system. This time around, there were no lines in parking lots, no breathless press coverage, no sense that a new computing era had begun. Indeed, some 40 percent of businesses said they had no plans to upgrade. Accessing the Net is what's most important, and no one needs the latest Microsoft OS to do that. But Ellison himself provided the most glaring sign that the computing landscape had changed. Fourteen years earlier, he had reacted to the Windows 95 launch by becoming one of Microsoft's loudest critics and most ambitious would-be competitors. This time, he said nothing. There was no need. The fight was over. Senior writer Daniel Roth wrote about Demand Media in issue 17.11.

TITLE: New Proofs Expand the Limits of What Cannot Be Known
DATE: Mar 9, 2025 8:00 AM
CONTENT:
The original version of this story appeared in Quanta Magazine. The world of mathematics is full of unreachable corners, where unsolvable problems live. Now, yet another has been exposed. In 1900, the eminent mathematician David Hilbert announced a list of 23 key problems to guide the next century of mathematical research. His problems not only provided a road map for the field but reflected a more ambitious vision—to build a firm foundation from which all mathematical truths could be derived. A key part of this vision was that mathematics should be “complete.” That is, all its statements should be provably true or false. In the 1930s, Kurt Gödel demonstrated that this is impossible: In any mathematical system, there are statements that can be neither proved nor disproved. A few years later, Alan Turing and others built on his work, showing that mathematics is riddled with “undecidable” statements—problems that cannot be solved by any computer algorithm. These results demonstrated that there are fundamental limits to what proof and computation are capable of. Some mathematics can simply never be known. Hilbert’s dream was dead. But it lived on in fragments. Many of the questions from his turn-of-the-century list still evoked his vision, allowing the idea of a complete mathematics to survive in narrower contexts. Chief among them was his 10th problem. It concerns Diophantine equations: polynomials with integer coefficients, such as x2 + y2 = 5.  These familiar equations are one of the most central objects of study in mathematics. For millennia, mathematicians have sought integer solutions to them. In this example, for instance, one solution is x = 1, y = 2 (since 12 + 22 = 5). Another is x = 2, y = −1. In 1900, David Hilbert posed 23 problems that he hoped would guide the next century of mathematical research. Those problems still influence the field today. Other Diophantine equations, such as x2 + y2 = 3, don’t have any integer solutions. Hilbert’s 10th problem asked whether it’s always possible to tell if a given Diophantine equation has integer solutions. Does an algorithm exist to determine this for every equation, or is the problem undecidable? There might be no hope for a complete and systematic approach to all of mathematics—or even all 23 of Hilbert’s problems—but one might still exist when it comes to Diophantine equations, forming a microcosm of his original program. “This problem is a very natural version of that dream,” said Peter Koymans of Utrecht University. In 1970, a Russian mathematician named Yuri Matiyasevich shattered this dream. He showed that there is no general algorithm that can determine whether any given Diophantine equation has integer solutions—that Hilbert’s 10th is an undecidable problem. You might be able to come up with an algorithm that can assess most equations, but it won’t work for every single one. In even this most straightforward kind of math, unknowability lurks. The mathematician Yuri Matiyasevich, seen here in 1969, proved that Hilbert’s 10th problem is undecidable. Mathematicians wanted to test the reach of Matiyasevich’s conclusion. Say you allow your Diophantine equations to have complex solutions (numbers that can be written with real and imaginary parts, and that aren’t limited to integers). In this case, every Diophantine equation has a solution, and the answer to Hilbert’s 10th problem is a resounding yes. But there’s a whole range of Diophantine equations between ones with solutions that must be integers and ones with solutions that can be complex. “It’s unsolvable for integers, then when you pass to much larger systems of numbers, you get solvability all of a sudden,” said Barry Mazur of Harvard University. “Where is the cutoff?” In the 50 years since Hilbert’s 10th problem was resolved, mathematicians have been searching for this cutoff. Now, Koymans and his longtime collaborator, Carlo Pagano of Concordia University in Montreal—as well as another team of researchers working independently—have taken a major step toward that goal. Both groups have proved that, for a vast and important collection of settings beyond integers, there is likewise no general algorithm to determine if any given Diophantine equation has a solution. The work not only allows mathematicians to get a more precise view of what they can and cannot know but gives them an entirely new level of control over one of the most central objects in mathematics. The new proofs focused on a natural extension of Hilbert’s 10th problem. The extension deals with Diophantine equations whose solutions belong to number systems that are close relatives of the integers. If you start with the numbers 1 and −1, you can add them in different combinations to get every other integer. But say you start with a different finite set of numbers—like 1, −1 and √2. You can add those numbers in different combinations to get a new number system, called a ring of integers (so named even though the ring need not contain only integers). Other rings of integers can be built out of sets of numbers that include, say, the square root of −1 (the imaginary number that mathematicians call i), or the cube root of 2. Is there an algorithm that can always determine whether a given Diophantine equation has solutions that fall in one of these rings of integers? Carlo Pagano of Concordia University recently used his expertise on elliptic curves to resolve a major conjecture in number theory. Mathematicians suspected that, for every single ring of integers—that is, infinitely many systems of numbers—the problem is still undecidable. This would extend the conclusion well beyond the initial, integer-focused scope of Hilbert’s 10th problem. To prove this, they hoped to follow in the footsteps of the proof of that original problem—the one involving only integer solutions. In general, undecidability proofs—proofs that determine whether there is a general algorithm that can answer a given question—follow the same recipe: They show that the problem of interest is equivalent to a famous undecidable problem in computer science called the halting problem. The halting problem asks whether an idealized computational device called a Turing machine, when fed a given input, will run forever or eventually halt. It’s known that there’s no algorithm that can answer this for every Turing machine. It’s possible to think of Diophantine equations as computational devices, too. Consider the equation y = x2. It has infinitely many integer solutions. If you plug in different integers for x and solve for y, the values you get all belong to a famous set of integers: the perfect squares. It is easy to imagine a computer program (that is, a Turing machine) that performs an equivalent task: “Compute the sequence of perfect squares.” Other Diophantine equations can encode other kinds of computations. Julia Robinson played a key role in the eventual proof of Hilbert’s 10th problem. “She made one of the fundamental breakthroughs in the history of mathematics,” said the mathematician Andrew Granville. Yet “somehow, the people that gave out prizes didn’t give her many.” To settle Hilbert’s original 10th problem, mathematicians built on this idea. In work that began with Julia Robinson and others around 1950 and culminated in Matiyasevich’s 1970 result, it was shown that for every Turing machine, there is a corresponding Diophantine equation. “It was completely unexpected,” said Hector Pasten of the Pontifical Catholic University of Chile in Santiago. “Diophantine equations over the integers are enough to define, basically, anything you can imagine.” Moreover, the mathematicians set up this elegant correspondence so that if a Turing machine halted for a given input, its corresponding Diophantine equation would have an integer solution. If the Turing machine ran forever, its corresponding Diophantine equation would have no solution. But this meant that Hilbert’s 10th problem encoded the halting problem: An algorithm that could sort Diophantine equations based on whether or not they had integer solutions would also be able to sort Turing machines based on whether or not they halted. In other words, Hilbert’s 10th problem is undecidable. Mathematicians hoped to follow the same approach to prove the extended, rings-of-integers version of the problem—but they hit a snag. The useful correspondence between Turing machines and Diophantine equations falls apart when the equations are allowed to have non-integer solutions. For instance, consider again the equation y = x2. If you’re working in a ring of integers that includes √2, then you’ll end up with some new solutions, such as x = √2, y = 2. The equation no longer corresponds to a Turing machine that computes perfect squares—and, more generally, the Diophantine equations can no longer encode the halting problem. But in 1988, a graduate student at New York University named Sasha Shlapentokh started to play with ideas for how to get around this problem. By 2000, she and others had formulated a plan. Say you were to add a bunch of extra terms to an equation like y = x2 that magically forced x to be an integer again, even in a different number system. Then you could salvage the correspondence to a Turing machine. Could the same be done for all Diophantine equations? If so, it would mean that Hilbert’s problem could encode the halting problem in the new number system. Over the years, Shlapentokh and other mathematicians figured out what terms they had to add to the Diophantine equations for various kinds of rings, which allowed them to demonstrate that Hilbert’s problem was still undecidable in those settings. They then boiled down all remaining rings of integers to one case: rings that involve the imaginary number i. Mathematicians realized that in this case, the terms they’d have to add could be determined using a special equation called an elliptic curve. But the elliptic curve would have to satisfy two properties. First, it would need to have infinitely many solutions. Second, if you switched to a different ring of integers—if you removed the imaginary number from your number system—then all the solutions to the elliptic curve would have to maintain the same underlying structure. As it turned out, building such an elliptic curve that worked for every remaining ring was an extremely subtle and difficult task. But Koymans and Pagano—experts on elliptic curves who had worked closely together since they were in graduate school—had just the right tool set to try. Since his time as an undergraduate, Koymans had been thinking about Hilbert’s 10th problem. Throughout graduate school, and throughout his collaboration with Pagano, it beckoned. “I spent a few days every year thinking about it and getting horribly stuck,” Koymans said. “I’d try three things and they’d all blow up in my face.” In 2022, while at a conference in Banff, Canada, he and Pagano ended up chatting about the problem. They hoped that together, they could build the special elliptic curve needed to resolve the problem. After finishing some other projects, they got to work. Peter Koymans, a mathematician at Utrecht University, has been thinking about Hilbert’s 10th problem since he was an undergraduate. They started with a simple equation for an elliptic curve that didn’t satisfy either of the required properties. They knew they could use a well-established technique called a quadratic twist—something they’d been studying for the better part of a decade—to tweak the equation so that it would meet the first condition. They simply had to multiply one of the equation’s variables by a specific number, and they’d get a new elliptic curve with infinitely many solutions. But this left them with a problem. They had no way to guarantee that this new curve satisfied the second property—that its solutions would look similar for rings that differed by an imaginary number. The mathematicians needed to get better control over the quadratic twist. They got stuck. “I had this dark feeling,” Koymans said. “I started to get suspicious that we were missing something.” Then, in summer 2024, while working on a different problem, the pair had to use quadratic twists again. One night, in the middle of this research, Koymans found himself lying awake, unable to stop thinking about Hilbert’s 10th problem. That other work, Koymans realized, gave them an important hint, one of those strange and surprising mathematical concordances that sometimes appear: If the number they used in the quadratic twist was the product of exactly three prime numbers, then they’d get the control they needed to guarantee the second property. But because their elliptic curve had to be constructed so carefully and meet so many specifications, there were lots of additional constraints on what those three primes could be. Could Koymans and Pagano find ones that worked—no matter which ring they were using? Pagano happened to have planned a visit to the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich, where Koymans was working at the time, a few days later. They spent the next week struggling at the blackboard together, trying to find primes that would meet all the constraints. Finally, they figured out that they had to use four primes, rather than three, to construct their quadratic twist. This allowed them to apply a method from an entirely separate area of math, called additive combinatorics, to ensure that the right combination of primes existed for every ring. That was the final piece: They’d built their elliptic curve. It gave them the recipe they needed to add terms to their Diophantine equations, which then enabled them to encode Turing machines—and the halting problem—in those equations, regardless of what number system they used. It was settled. Hilbert’s 10th problem is undecidable for every ring of integers. The result was solidified further last Thursday, when, less than two months after Koymans and Pagano posted their paper online, an independent team of four mathematicians announced a new proof of the same result. Instead of looking for a special elliptic curve, they had relied on a different kind of equation to do the same job. Both groups hope to use their techniques—which give them unprecedented control over elliptic curves and related equations—to make progress on other problems as well. “There’s a possibility that the two methods could be used together to do even more,” said Manjul Bhargava, a mathematician at Princeton University and one of the authors of the second proof. Meanwhile, the search for where undecidability ends and decidability begins is not over: Mathematicians are continuing to explore Hilbert’s 10th problem in new settings. This is just one of many questions, according to Andrew Granville of the University of Montreal, that “reflect the philosophical side of what in the world is true.” All knowledge has limits. “It reminds us there are things that are just not doable,” Granville said. “It doesn’t matter who you are or what you are.” Original story reprinted with permission from Quanta Magazine, an editorially independent publication of the Simons Foundation whose mission is to enhance public understanding of science by covering research developments and trends in mathematics and the physical and life sciences.

TITLE: What’s Driving Tesla’s Woes?
DATE: Mar 8, 2025 5:00 AM
CONTENT:
Tesla sales fell in the US once again last month, following a wider global trend that further fuels the suggestion that the growing backlash against billionaire CEO Elon Musk could be impacting Tesla at retail. According to Kelley Blue Book, Tesla shifted 43,650 EVs in February, a decrease of nearly 6 percent from the 46,262 sold in the same month last year. It's far from the crash seen in much of the rest of the world, with drops of over 75 percent in Europe in the first two months of the year (the UK being one of the the only markets bucking the trend, with Tesla's February sales jumping by 20 percent compared with the same month last year), but—whatever the reason—sales are stalling. In the US, the month-over-month sales decline in February was primarily driven by significant drops in Cybertruck and Model 3 sales, which fell by 32.5 percent and 17.5 percent, respectively. But Stephanie Valdez Streaty, director of industry insights for Cox Automotive, says these drops aren't that bad when considered within the wider market. “Compared to the overall EV market, Tesla’s decline in February is relatively moderatecompared to some other manufacturers," she says, "indicating that while there was a decline, it was not as severe as those seen by some competitors.” Some analysts blame Tesla’s lackluster sales on inventory snafus, customers waiting for the refreshed Model Y, and fierce competition from auto rivals. Others point to the company’s habit of making deliveries in batches, resulting in big variations in registrations between months. Tesla's Model Y is awaiting a refresh. Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas even suggests the downturn in sales is all part of a key turning point for Tesla, as it moves beyond a car company into a robotics-focused behemoth. “Tesla’s softer auto deliveries are emblematic of a company in the transition from an automotive ‘pure play’ to a highly diversified play on AI and robotics,” the Tesla bull told clients in a note. “While the journey may be volatile and nonlinear," he continues, "we believe 2025 will be a year where investors will continue to appreciate and value these existing and nascent industries of embodied AI, where we believe Tesla has established a material competitive advantage.” However, there has been the feeling that at least some of the fall could be due to anger over Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s political activism and the decisions made by the so-called Department of Government Efficiency under his leadership. Since mid-February, Tesla showrooms have attracted protesters in 100 or so cities across the US, eager to let passersby know their feelings about the chainsaw-wielding Musk. These largely good-natured, sidewalk-staged protests—some with Mariachi bands, puppeteers, and large cardboard Cybertrucks to decorate—have been organized by a website called TeslaTakedown, and they attracted plenty of media coverage in the process. Alex Winter, a Los Angeles-based documentary maker—and the titular Bill from 1988 time-travel comedy Bill & Ted’s Excellent Adventure—is the creator of the website. He tells WIRED that the TeslaTakedown movement wants to topple Musk: “We aim to devalue the brand. It’s a very simple and effective means for people to get onto the street and protest.” Media coverage amplifies the movement’s message, says Winter. “We want to spread verifiable, factual information on Musk, DOGE, and why Tesla should be devalued.” “Musk himself is toxifying the Tesla brand,” Winter says. “We’re just helping him.” TeslaTakedown started last month, kicked off by a February 10 posting on Bluesky by Joan Donovan, a disinformation researcher and assistant professor of journalism and emerging media studies at Boston University. “Come out and participate in an international picket #TeslaTakeover locally,” she wrote, later agreeing with renaming the movement. “I asked myself, what was I willing to physically do to raise awareness [about Musk]? Well, I’m willing to go out on Saturdays and protest in front of a Tesla dealership,” Donovan tells WIRED. “I made a flyer and started circulating it online. Alex saw my post, and we started texting about what to do; it all came together super fast.” At the first demonstration in Boston on February 15, there were 50 people. By the third week, this had risen to 300. “I’ve met teachers, people who work in public health, people who are retired, students at universities—all Americans who want to see DOGE disappear,” says Donovan. “It’s not only a strategic boycott of Tesla, it’s a polyvocal protest where lots of grievances are aired.” Elon Musk and Tesla didn't respond to requests for comment. Erica Chenoweth, a political scientist at Harvard University, has studied over 300 modern uprisings worldwide and found that change usually becomes inevitable when just 3.5 percent of a population join a movement. “There are typically far more people who sympathize with movements than people who actively participate in them,” Chenoweth tells WIRED. So might TeslaTakedown work quickly? “Instead of thinking about how long it takes,” she says, “I typically look to see whether a movement is building pressure and momentum with each subsequent action. "In the social science of these movements, many people talk about eliciting defections—making people within different pillars of support shift their loyalty away from the status quo. In the case of corporations, those pillars can include shareholders, workers, suppliers, distributors, advertisers, consumers, and those around them.” Those pillars may already be showing signs of instability. Across Reddit, TikTok, Facebook, and even X, posts have started to stack up of people saying they are ditching their Teslas. Singer Sheryl Crow was one of the more high-profile among them, who posted an Instagram video on Valentine’s Day wishing good riddance to her Tesla as it was driven away on a flatbed truck. “There comes a time when you have to decide who you are willing to align with. So long Tesla,” she wrote, adding that she was donating the sale proceeds to National Public Radio, because it was "under threat from President Musk.” Sleep researcher Asa Farnham lives in Rochester, New York, and used to work in a Tesla showroom. He has owned five Tesla EVs, previously owned company stock, and has attended shareholder meetings. He also made the decision to part ways with his Tesla recently. “I’m not rich, so I really hemmed and hawed about getting rid of a perfectly fine vehicle but, not being a Vulcan, every time I drove the car I felt emotionally sick,” he tells WIRED. “Finally, in December, I couldn’t take it anymore, and traded my Model 3 for a Rivian and reduced a significant amount of cognitive dissonance.” “The decision to ditch was difficult,” he remembers, “like breaking up with someone. As an environmentalist, I was aligned with [Tesla’s] mission statement to accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy.” But Farnham started souring on Tesla in 2022 after Musk purchased Twitter. “2024 was the nail in the coffin,” he says. “Musk amplified election conspiracy theories, extreme far-right views, and tweeted more vile things. I was done.” Another Tesla ditcher who spoke to WIRED has been a staffer at the US Department of Transportation in Washington, DC, for 25 years. He asked to remain anonymous due to concerns he could lose his job for speaking out. He had been a Tesla owner since 2018, but replaced his 2023 Model 4 for a Kia EV6 late last year. “I used to think Musk was a goofy but intelligent man [who] had good intentions,” he says. “My feelings changed around the time he bought Twitter. I loathe that, as a government employee, I have to submit five bullet points each week detailing what I’ve been doing at work. I cannot imagine the shame I’d feel if I still owned a Tesla.” That sentiment is not an outlier—many more ex-Tesla owners reached out to WIRED to share their reasons for ditching their cars, but none were prepared to be named, due to concerns for their safety. “I am the child of German immigrants,” another tells WIRED, “and the [Nazi-style] salute was very much when I had enough. I owned a Tesla Model 3 RWD 2018 from the first year of delivery until last month; I got a Volkswagen ID4 instead. I am happier not to be driving a car associated with Musk. Every American knows that your car says something about you: Driving a Tesla used to say ‘I am driving to a better future’—now it says ‘I believe in destroying government.’” And yet Tesla’s US market dominance remains staggering. It has a 48.7 percent EV market share in the US, with the next biggest automaker being Ford at 7.5 percent. Ivan Drury, director of insights at car-buying site Edmunds, believes that when it comes a big purchase like a car, the majority of people are more focused on price and perceived value than the politics of a company CEO. “There’s a huge swath of the population that doesn’t care about politics,” says Drury. “Many people will put aside their feelings about politics when purchasing a car. Tesla is utilizing several incentivization methods, including low APRs, leasing, outright discounts, and free supercharging. These might be enough for someone who sees the protesting in front of the stores and thinks nothing of it, especially as you can circumvent the dealership experience and buy online with delivery to your door.” Whether anti-Musk sloganeering, ownership ditching, and showroom picketing can meaningfully reduce new car sales at the EV behemoth is moot. Tesla’s share price might be trending down right now, but the gains made after Trump’s election mean there’s still a long way to go before the stock even falls to last year’s lows. However, with the company’s valuation recently dropping below $1 trillion, Musk has lost more than $100 billion from his paper fortune, and if Tesla tanks, he’ll lose a whole bunch more. This isn’t fanciful. Barclays research analyst and Tesla bull Dan Levy argues that Tesla shares are “disconnected from fundamentals” with “stock trading at [many] times earnings.” And for Levy, “what matters is narrative,” with the “markets not really challenging any of the things Tesla is saying.” Markets can be slow, somehow yet to realize that Tesla’s price-to-earnings ratio don't really add up. It would take 140 years to recoup an investment at Tesla’s current earnings rate. Ford’s ratio of 6.5 and Mercedes-Benz at 5.7 are the realistic ones. But Tesla’s share price is at profound risk from targeted activism. “We’re doing [TeslaTakedown] to devalue the stock,” says Winter. “We could see the rapid decline of Tesla’s stock value and the diminishment of sales. Musk’s attachment to Trump did a lot of that. And I think his [Nazi-style] salute did a lot of that.” Tesla’s share price is currently 263, down from the 480s following Trump’s inauguration. “If it gets down to 120, you’ll start to see a lot of angry shareholders,” believes Donovan, “people who bought the dream.” She, and many others, hope TeslaTakedown will become a nightmare for Musk.

TITLE: Social Security Workers Aren’t Allowed to Read This Story

CONTENT:
Employees at the Social Security Administration (SSA) were informed on Thursday morning that new rules forbid them from accessing “general news” websites, including those that have been at the forefront of the reporting on Elon Musk’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) effort. In an email reviewed by WIRED and addressed to “all SSA employees” from a mailing list called “internal communications,” the agency informed employees that it was “implementing additional restrictions to the categories of websites prohibited from government-furnished equipment. Effective today, March 6, 2025, the categories include: Online shopping; General News; and Sports.” The headline read “Internet Browsing from Government Equipment.” The email did not specify which websites in particular were to be blocked. However, WIRED has confirmed with two sources inside the SSA that Wired.com is no longer accessible today, though it was accessible previously. The sources also confirmed that the websites of The Washington Post, The New York Times, and MSNBC were inaccessible. However, the sources were able to access other news websites including Politico and Axios. “Local news blocked,” says one source at SSA, who was granted anonymity over fears of retribution. “So if there was a local shooting or something, I wouldn’t be able to see.” It’s unclear who has implemented the block list or what criteria were used to populate it, but it appears not to be based on ideological grounds, as Fox News and Breitbart are also blocked. On Friday, weeks after DOGE engineers were installed at SSA, the agency announced plans to cut 7,000 employees. Many of the agency’s most senior staff have resigned. This includes former SSA commissioner Michelle King, who has decades of experience within the agency. She was replaced by acting commissioner Leland Dudek, a mid-level staffer who claimed in a LinkedIn post, reviewed by WIRED, that he had been punished by King for helping DOGE engineers when they first arrived. Musk and Donald Trump have also continued to push the conspiracy theory that millions of dead people are continuing to collect social security benefits, despite the fact those claims have been debunked. In the hours after the initial email was sent about blocking news sites, some employees received another email from their managers providing instructions on how to disable news showing up on the Edge landing page. This was not a requirement but a recommendation to help employees resist the temptation to click on news links, a source who had received the email told WIRED. Those trying to visit Wired.com were greeted with a page replicating much of what was in the initial email. It also listed a “URL Reputiation” score, though it was unclear where that score was being sourced from, or if it has a bearing on site access. Different blocked news websites were given different scores, according to screenshots viewed by WIRED. SSA employees typically use computers with Microsoft’s Edge installed as the internet browser. The default landing page on that browser is set to show news headlines, according to several sources at SSA. “Employees with a legitimate business [sic] should submit an exception SAM request for their supervisor's review,” the email continued. “These additional restrictions will help reduce risk and better protect the sensitive information entrusted to us in our many systems.” On Reddit, multiple members of the FedNews subreddit who said they worked at the SSA claimed that accessing news in a timely manner was an essential part of their job. Others pointed out that being able to make purchases online was a core component of their work. After this article was published, an SSA spokesperson told WIRED that it implemented the restrictions because “employees should be focused on mission-critical work and serving the American people.” It did not respond to requests for comment on why some news websites were blocked and others were not. Employees at several other US government agencies contacted by WIRED said similar blocks on news pages had not been implemented on their networks. This story has been updated with comment from SSA.
