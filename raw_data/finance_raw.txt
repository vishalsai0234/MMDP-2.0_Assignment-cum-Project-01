TITLE: eVTOLS: Are flying cars finally becoming reality?
DATE: 11:15 PM EDT

 In this video Inventors have been fixated on the idea of "flying cars" for nearly as long as they have been on the road, with prototypes dating as far back as the 1940s. Innovators and investors today, however, prefer the acronym eVTOL, which stands for electric vertical take-off and landing. As the name suggests, eVTOLS are powered by electricity, not fuel. They take off and land vertically, like what you're used to seeing with a helicopter, but many also fly like a traditional aircraft. More than 400 companies and innovators have registered designs on the World eVTOL Aircraft Directory. CNBC has focused on eVTOL companies like Lilium, EHang, Alef and mentions Joby Aviation, Archer Aviation and Vertical Aerospace. The broader industry has attracted billions of dollars in funding over the last decade. For some, those investments could really pay off. One Markets and Markets forecast estimated that the eVTOL market will grow from $1.2 billion in 2023 to $23.4 billion in 2030. That's an annual average growth rate of 52%. So, are we in the golden age of eVTOL development or the "mother of all aerospace bubbles?" Watch the video above to learn what the field will need to do to reach its ambitious targets.

TITLE: CNBC's Inside India newsletter: Indian consumption stocks await a tax-cut bump
DATE: Published Thu, Mar 6 202510:07 AM EST
CONTENT:
 This report is from this week's CNBC's "Inside India" newsletter which brings you timely, insightful news and market commentary on the emerging powerhouse and the big businesses behind its meteoric rise. Like what you see? You can subscribe here. It has been over a month since India unveiled its Union Budget, which offered a massive tax relief aimed at boosting urban consumption. The move, however, has done little to lift consumer stocks. The Nifty FMCG (fast-moving consumer goods) index — which captures 15 stocks listed on India's National Stock Exchange — rose over 3% as the budget was tabled on Feb. 1. This rally, however, quickly fizzled out. The index has declined in 18 out of the 23 sessions following the budget boost and is down nearly 9% so far this year, compared with the 4.72% drop in the Nifty 50 Index. The expectation was for shares to rally as investors factored in higher consumer spending once tax cuts come into effect in April. However, investors have had to curb their enthusiasm due to a confluence of factors. Many consumers are likely to pocket the higher disposable income resulting from these tax cuts, or spend the money on non-FMCG goods such as motor vehicles, according to Kranthi Bathini, director of equity strategy at WealthMills Securities. "It's not an overnight thing, where FMCG stocks will rise now with the tax cuts and RBI's [Reserve Bank of India] rate cut. It will take some time to see the impact," Bathini said. Higher valuations have also dimmed the appeal of many FMCG stocks, analysts said. Another reason for their underperformance is the "reasonably high penetration level" of certain personal and home-care products, said Pramod Gubbi, co-founder of Marcellus Investment Managers. This implies that companies have already captured a sizable market share, leaving little room for further growth. Source: NSE Statistics "Indian FMCG companies have had anemic volume growth even before the recent consumption slowdown set in the July to September quarter," Gubbi added. Companies such as Nestle India — with popular brands like Maggi, Nescafé and KitKat under its umbrella — have also been targeting consumers with higher disposable incomes who can spend on premium products. Data from the World Bank shows that India's GDP per capita grew 7.1% in 2023 from a year ago to $2,200. Many companies were banking on a "premiumization wave." They expected consumers to seek better products as they became more affluent, but sales have not met expectations, Gubbi told CNBC's Inside India. The growth of direct-to-consumer firms has also taken revenue away from FMCG companies with traditional sales channels, he added. Since February, shares in ITC — the top holding in the Nifty FMCG index with a 30.7% weight — have slumped 12.3%, while Hindustan Unilever (20.2% weight) has lost 11.4%. Other top-weighted companies such as Tata Consumer Products and Nestle India have declined 10.5% and 5.4%, respectively. WealthMills Securities' Bathini noted that the earnings outlook for FMCG companies was not particularly bright. "Consumer stocks like Hindustan Unilever, Godrej Consumer Products and others were facing some kind of margin pressure because of the weak demand — which was also seen in the second-quarter GDP numbers," Bathini told CNBC's Inside India. However, he added that the faster growth seen in fiscal third-quarter GDP could signal "some kind of improvement" in the consumer-focused companies' results. India's GDP data for the quarter ending December showed a 6.9% year-on-year growth in private consumption, up from 5.9% three months earlier. The question for investors is whether they should bet on the FMCG sector — or look elsewhere. With consumption trends "still patchy at best across segments," said Harsha Upadhyaya, chief investment officer at Kotak Mahindra Asset Management, adding that FMCG stocks would "need better earnings growth and/or lower valuations for sustained performance." "Without this, the stocks may be range-bound or in line with market movement," Upadhyaya told CNBC's Inside India. For instance, Hindustan Unilever trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of 48.5, compared with the Nifty 50 index P/E of nearly 20. Marcellus' Gubbi is positive on specific segments within the consumer space, rather than the sector as a whole, highlighting food and beverage as well as kitchenware — which are still growing, given lower barriers to entry and sales on e-commerce platforms. Perhaps, the lesson for investors looking to find bargains in India's consumer sector is to be as discerning in their stock selections as they are in their weekly grocery shopping. India Commerce and Industry Minister Piyush Goyal visits Washington Monday. The minister is expected to meet U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer and U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnic to discuss a trade agreement, according to an official. Goyal's visit occurs just weeks before reciprocal tariffs from the U.S. come into force, which means Indian goods imported into the U.S. would face high levies, leading to approximately $7 billion in annual losses for India, Citi estimated. U.S. wants zero tariffs on car imports in India. As part of a potential trade deal between Washington and New Delhi, the Trump administration is pressing the latter to remove its tariffs on automobile imports. However, India is reluctant to accede to that request, although it is open to lowering levies further, Reuters reported, citing three sources familiar with the matter. Removing auto tariffs in India — which are as high as 110% — will smoothen Tesla's entry into the market. The Elon Musk-founded company is preparing to start selling its electric vehicles in India. India to remain crucial to the global supply chain. The South Asian nation has the highest average tariffs on U.S. goods, so it comes as little surprise that U.S. President Donald Trump has threatened to slap India with retaliatory import levies. However, India is becoming increasingly important for manufacturers diversifying from China, which means tariffs might not diminish New Delhi's importance as a production hub, said Charles van der Steene, president of North America for Maersk. British smartphone startup Nothing looks to India. Nothing, which launched its new Phone (3a) device on Tuesday, is targeting the Indian market, according to Ben Wood, chief analyst at market research firm CCS Insight. The company experienced 557% year-over-year growth in India last year, making Nothing the fastest-growing smartphone brand in 2024, founder Carl Pei said in January. Furthermore, the company's co-founder Akis Evangelidis plans to move to India to head up operations there later this year. Indian stock are showing signs of a pick up, after the Nifty 50 index closed at 22,544.70, rising just under 1% from the week before.The benchmark 10-year Indian government bond yield edged down slightly to 6.687%. In CNBC TV this week, Michel Doukeris, CEO of the world's largest brewer AB InBev, said that India is "one of the big markets for growth in the future." The South Asian nation is already the third-largest global market for Budweiser — and with India's "very young" and urbanizing population that is experiencing an increase purchasing power, there is a "massive opportunity" for the brewer. However, obstacles such as high regulation and taxes on alcohol mean the road ahead won't be completely smooth sailing. Meanwhile, CNBC's Seema Mody reported that investors are rethinking their exposure to emerging markets because of Trump tariffs, and taking note of which countries are most and least dependent on the U.S. India, however, "continues to be a head scratcher." The results of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's efforts to negotiation an agreement with Trump are still uncertain, weighing on Indian stocks. Moreover, the country's equities are overvalued compared with that of China, even after the latter's rally in tech stocks last week, an analyst said. The U.S. economy is in focus this week, with February's jobs data out this Friday and the consumer price index on Wednesday.

TITLE: Tesla shares have declined every week since Elon Musk went to Washington
DATE: Published Fri, Mar 7 20254:12 PM EST
CONTENT:
 In this article Tesla's stock has never had a stretch this red. For seven straight weeks, since Elon Musk went to Washington to join the Trump administration, shares in his automaker have declined, closing Friday at $270.48. It's the longest such losing streak for Tesla in its 15 years as a public company. Tesla shares finished the week down more than 10% and at their lowest level since Nov. 5, Election Day, when they closed at $251.44. Since the stock peaked at almost $480 on Dec. 17, Tesla has lost well over $800 billion in market cap. Several Wall Street firms this week, including Bank of America, Baird and Goldman Sachs, cut their price targets on Tesla. In slashing their target from $490 to $380, analysts at Bank of America cited concerns about the company's falling new vehicle sales and the lack of a recent update from Musk on a "low-cost model." Goldman Sachs, which cut its price target on the stock to $320 from $345, also pointed to falling electric vehicle sales for Tesla in the first two months of the year across several markets in Europe, China and parts of the U.S. The Goldman analysts noted that Tesla faces "a tough competitive environment for FSD" in China, where key competitors "do not generally require a separate software purchase for smart driving features." FSD, or Full Self-Driving (Supervised), is Tesla's partially automated driving system, which the company sells as a premium option in the U.S. Baird added Tesla to its "bearish fresh picks" this week, with analysts at the firm writing that "production downtime" will complicate "the supply-side of the equation" for Tesla as the company shifts to manufacturing the new version of its Model Y SUV. But Wall Street isn't just concerned about fundamental metrics such as sales and production figures. Investors are also trying to assess how much Musk's politics and work in the White House will pressure Tesla, and for how long. "Musk's involvement with the Trump administration adds uncertainty to the demand-side," Baird analysts wrote. Before taking on his role as advisor to President Donald Trump and as leader of the so-called Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, Musk was already heading up his many private ventures, including artificial intelligence startup xAI, social media company X, and aerospace and defense contractor SpaceX. Now Musk, the world's wealthiest person, has become the public face of the Trump administration's effort to dramatically reduce the federal government's workforce, spending and capacity. Meanwhile, he continues to post incendiary political rhetoric on X, slamming judges whose decisions he doesn't like, and promoting false Kremlin talking points about Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Anti-Musk and anti-Tesla sentiment have been rising in the U.S. and Europe, with an outburst of protests and suspected criminal acts of arson and vandalism at Tesla facilities. Even the most bullish analysts, and many fans, have had to acknowledge the impact of Musk's politics on the desirability of Tesla and its products to a wide swath of customers and investors. EV advocates at Cleantechnica, which has long promoted Tesla on its site, ran an ethics-focused column Thursday pondering whether Tesla owners should sell their cars and whether the Tesla board should fire Musk as CEO. Musk and Tesla didn't immediately respond to requests for comment. In a note out Friday, Wedbush Securities' Dan Ives wrote, "Tesla bulls find themselves with their back against the wall facing global negative sentiment around Musk/DOGE and the Trump Administration." He called it a "gut check moment for the Tesla bulls (including ourselves)." Wedbush said it's using the sell-off as an opportunity to add Tesla to its "Best Ideas" list, and set its 12-month price target at $550. "The best thing that ever happened to Musk and Tesla was Trump in the White House as this will create a deregulatory environment with a federal autonomous roadmap central to the Tesla golden strategic vision," the firm wrote. The Tesla bulls see the potential for the company to soon launch affordable new model EVs, a robotaxi and driverless ride-hail service, and to deliver humanoid robots capable of factory work in the not-too-distant future. Ives said he expects Musk will become more focused on Tesla and his other companies in the second half of 2025. Analysts at TD Cowen are also optimistic. In a note Thursday, they wrote, "Tesla now appears to be in the early innings of a major 2025-26 product cycle, one that we believe could re-invigorate volume growth and boost overall share price sentiment."

TITLE: People said Naples was ‘dangerous.’ So this British film director leaned on her working-class roots to show a different side of the city
DATE: Published Fri, Feb 28 20251:37 AM EST
CONTENT:
 CONVERGE LIVE - Singapore, March 12-13 2025 - Request invitation When Trudie Styler was growing up in 1960s working-class England, her family expected her to become a typist at a paintbrush factory. But life turned out rather more grandly: Going to a good high school meant Styler "started to dream much bigger," she told CNBC by video call. She trained as an actress, joined the Royal Shakespeare Company and met — and then married — Gordon Sumner, better known as rock star Sting. The couple have homes in New York, the U.K. and Italy. Now a movie producer and director, Styler says it was her "quite tough" childhood that helped give her the confidence to direct her latest film, a documentary named "Posso Entrare? An Ode To Naples," (streaming in the U.K. on Disney+ and in the U.S. on Hulu). The film saw Styler wandering through the small, lava-paved streets of the Italian city, knocking on doors and asking: "Can I come in?" interviewing people about their daily lives, as well as residents affected by the city's notorious mafia, known as the Camorra. Growing up in a terraced house in the the village of Stoke Prior in the English county of Worcestershire meant that as children, "We were in and out of each other's homes," Styler told CNBC. Her mother was a dinner lady and her father a factory worker, and one day, wondering when her dinner would be ready, Styler sought her mother and found her in a neighbor's home helping to deliver a baby. "I sort of timorously said, 'I'm hungry,' and ... my mother said: 'Get out!'" she recalled. And when Styler told her parents she wanted to act, it didn't go down very well. "That began a very big fight with my dad, Harry," Styler said. "I don't think he understood that ... going to grammar school and learning languages and learning sciences, you know that your horizons, of course, broadened," she said. "That sort of, confidence that I had when I got to Naples just emerged," she said. Styler has long had a relationship with Italy, having acted in three films in the country in the 1980s and giving birth to her third child, Eliot, in Pisa in 1990. Later that decade, she and Sting bought an estate in Tuscany, and Styler would often go to the Ischia Film Festival in the bay of Naples. But when Styler's producer asked if she'd like to direct a documentary about the city, she realized she didn't know much about it. "Do you know Naples?" she would ask friends, with some repeating "hearsay" about it being dangerous. But she decided to go with a "blank canvas," she told CNBC. "I'm going to take away this feeling that has been bestowed upon me, of be afraid, be very afraid of Napoli, and investigate it myself … really trying to find from the locals what they thought of their own city," Styler said of her approach. "People would pour out their personal stories," she said of her door-knocking. Among the characters in the film are glove maker Michelle and the eight-year-old grandson she has looked after since his mother died, and Nora, a swimmer in her 90s who remembers Hitler's 1938 tour of Naples with Mussolini.— "It's just so fascinating to go to a place with some preconceived ideas and just [be] divested of all that, and to allow yourself the magical and rich experience of discovering a city and its people," Styler said. In an organized interview, Styler also met Roberto Saviano, author of the book "Gomorrah," which tells the story of the Camorra's "monstrous" activities in Naples. He has been in hiding and under police escort since its publication in 2006. "I thought they could turn lawyers against me, which they did," he says of the Comorra's response to his book. "But I didn't think I would have triggered a military, physical rage," he tells Styler in the film. One of the most striking groups Styler interviews is campaigning organization Forti Guerriere, which was set up by several women after their friend Fortuna was killed by her husband in the city. They successfully campaigned for his sentence to be increased from 10 years to 30 years. "Women are really now, taking a very big stance against femicide and violence in the household. It's very heartening to see that," Styler told CNBC. Meanwhile, former mayoral candidate Alessandra Clemente talks to Styler about her mother's accidental killing by the Camorra in Naples and her efforts to help young men in the town seek a non-violent life, and the film also introduces Antonio Loffredo, a priest who opens his church to local groups. Through her production company Maven Pictures, which she founded with producer Celine Rattray, Styler seeks to "push the dial" for women in the film industry, and the firm has made 28 films since its founding nearly two decades ago. "When we set up Maven, we said, OK, we're going to give actresses more opportunity to bring us their projects, to be our co-producers, if we like the script enough and feel that we can do it," Styler said. Styler's advice to women earlier in their production careers is to "look for stories that have a strong female narrative, so that you can create employment for women," but she lamented that most screenwriters are men — who "often" write men into leading roles. Some production roles are still male-dominated, such as cinematographers or directors of photography, Styler said. "For many, many years that it's been sort of like, oh, well, women couldn't possibly be cinematographers lugging around that camera. I mean … it's quite upsetting when you hear language like that," she said. But streaming services are hiring women "much more" than they have in the past, Styler said. And the movie industry has "got better for actresses," she said. "Now they're not, sort of like sent out to pasture at 40, as they used to be. It's good to see that women's careers have lengthened quite a bit, but there's a long way to go," Styler said.

TITLE: Treasury Secretary Bessent says economy could be 'starting to roll a little bit'
DATE: Published Fri, Mar 7 20258:13 AM EST
CONTENT:
 Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Friday acknowledged some signs of weakness in the U.S. economy. "Could we be seeing that this economy that we inherited starting to roll a bit? Sure. And look, there's going to be a natural adjustment as we move away from public spending to private spending," Bessent said on CNBC's "Squawk Box." "The market and the economy have just become hooked. We've become addicted to this government spending, and there's going to be a detox period," he added. Describing the economy as inherited is a reference to the administration under then-President Joe Biden. Current President Donald Trump took office on Jan. 20. Under Biden, the U.S. saw generally strong economic growth. However, there were signs of a slowdown in late 2024, and inflation remained above the Federal Reserve's 2% target. In its first few months, the Trump administration has taken steps to reshape global trade policies and to reduce the federal workforce. There has not been much hard economic data reflecting Trump's term, though consumer surveys have shown a decline in confidence. The February jobs report was released after Bessent's comments and showed unemployment ticking up to 4.1% from 4.0%. The economy added 151,000 jobs during the month, below the 170,000 projected by economists, according to Dow Jones. One area where Trump's policies could be felt quickly are tariffs. The president has hit Canada, Mexico and China with tariffs in his first nearly two months in office, though the Canada and Mexico efforts now have a lengthy list of exemptions. The administration plans to implement broader tariffs in April. "Tariffs are a one-time price adjustment," Bessent said, pushing back against the idea that tariffs would fuel continued inflation. Bessent also said the administration was "not getting much credit" for areas where costs have fallen since Trump's inauguration, such as oil prices and mortgage rates.

TITLE: Goodyear Tire's transformation plan is underway — in the sky and on the ground
DATE: Published Sat, Mar 8 20258:00 AM EST
CONTENT:
 AKRON, Ohio — Does the Goodyear blimp sell tires? That was one question veteran auto executive Mark Stewart had when he started as CEO of Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. a little more than a year ago, seeking to lead a transformation plan for the quintessential American company. For a century, Goodyear Tire has used helium-filled airships to tout its brand. Stewart wanted to ensure consumers connected the blimps to the company's products and services, which it has increasingly done as Goodyear celebrates the 100-year anniversary of its first blimp, called Pilgrim, in 1925. "The answer is yes it can, and yes it does," Stewart told CNBC during an interview at the company's headquarters. "It really is about using one of our most powerful marketing icon pieces, the blimp, both here as well as in Europe, to in fact sell tires." The blimp question was an easy one to answer compared with the rest of the challenges Stewart, who has become known for transformation plans, has tackled since joining the company in January 2024. Much like automakers and related suppliers, Goodyear's business is rapidly changing with new technologies, increased competition from low-cost countries such as China and investor skepticism on whether a legacy company can transform itself to be more efficient, profitable and competitive. Goodyear's answer, which was prompted by activist investor Elliott Investment Management revealing a stake in the company in 2023, is "Goodyear Forward" — a two-year transformation plan that ends in December. The plan includes doubling operating income margin to 10%, enacting top-line and cost reductions of $1.5 billion, and bringing in gross proceeds of $2 billion in business asset sales. It's also reducing its debt load by $1.5 billion, net of approximately $1.1 billion for restructuring. To assist, the company is investing in and deploying artificial intelligence technologies and 3D-printing for things such as tread teeth, as well as using simulation to speed development and production of its products. Roughly halfway through the initial plan, Stewart said Goodyear is ahead of schedule for its benchmarks, including upping the cuts by $200 million. But investors remain skeptical amid geopolitical uncertainty such as tariffs and a disbelief in the longevity, or "stickiness" in tire terminology, of the changes. Stewart believes Goodyear is at a "show me" period with investors, which he plans to continue to deliver on as the company has reported five consecutive quarters of margin growth and its best retail performance in more than 20 years. "We're continuing to execute, and I think we're doing a better job of communicating in terms of our single and double hit wins as we go through the Goodyear Forward, and structurally changing the business," said Stewart, whose father worked at an Alabama plant for Goodyear's recently sold Dunlop brand. "It's continuing to stack those up." Shares of Goodyear received a 17% boost after the company reported its 2024 and fourth-quarter results. But shares of the company are down 30.3% since the plan's announcement, and 33.4% since Stewart became CEO. A spokesperson for Elliott, which has taken board seats at companies including Southwest Airlines and eBay, declined to comment on Goodyear. Goodyear reached a cooperation agreement with Elliott, which FactSet reports retains a roughly 9% stake in the company, that included adding three directors to its board. Stewart succeeded Goodyear CEO Richard Kramer, who retired after 14 years leading the company. What started out as a new emerging aeronautics business for Goodyear in 1910 has grown into a cultural icon as the company's Goodyear blimps have flown over major sporting events and historical landmarks. The first Goodyear blimp, called Pilgrim, took flight in 1925 from a hangar the company continues to use near Akron, Ohio. Goodyear has built more than 300 blimps, also known as airships, including over 200 for the U.S. Navy to patrol oceans during World War II. There have been five major generation changes of the blimps, according to Gerald Hissem, a chief pilot who has flown Goodyear blimps for 27 years. "The technology really has advanced," he told CNBC during a tour of the company's hangar in Ohio. "It's totally different flying." Today's airship debuted in 2014 and feature a "fly-by-wire" system that eliminate many physical parts, according to Hissem. They were designed by Zeppelin Luftschifftechnik GmbH in Germany to Goodyear's specifications, followed by a joint team constructing them in the U.S. The blimps are powered by three four-cylinder engines — left, right and back — that are each capable of 200 horsepower. They can travel at speeds of up to 73 miles per hour. Other blimp facts include: Airship bases: Pompano Beach, Florida; Carson, California; Suffield, Ohio; and Essen, Germany. Names: America, Columbia, Defender, Eagle, Enterprise, Europa, Mayflower, Pilgrim, Rainbow, Ranger, Reliance, Resolute, Spirit of Akron, Spirit of Goodyear, Volunteer. Longest flight? In March 1957, an airship called Snow Bird went 11 consecutive days in flight. It flew from Weymouth, Massachusetts, to Europe, Africa and Key West, Florida, without refueling or landing. Want to ride? Goodyear's current blimps have a bathroom, room for two pilots and typically six to eight passengers. To be a blimp passenger is by invitation only, but the company also donates "ride certificates," largely for nonprofit causes. Goodyear is well on its way to achieving its plan, but its success is not guaranteed. In addition to achieving its own targets, it's unclear how changing regulations such as President Donald Trump's tariffs will impact the tire company's business. Stewart, prior to the implementation and then delay of 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico for automakers and suppliers, declined to go into detail on Goodyear's preparation and potential contingency plans for such tariffs on North American operations as well as other countries. "We're running all the scenarios with that right now," Stewart said. "And bottom line is we'll continue to add projects into Goodyear Forward to keep marching on our journey." Goodyear has built up an international business from its humble beginnings 127 years ago in Akron, Ohio. The company employs about 68,000 people and manufactures its products in 53 facilities in 20 countries, with major operations in North and South America, Asia-Pacific and Europe. Its manufacturing operations in the Americas, which represented roughly half of its tire sales in 2024, include making tires in eight plants in the U.S., two plants in both Canada and Mexico and a plant each in Brazil, Chile, Colombia and Peru. The Goodyear Forward plan reaches across the operations, aiming to achieve the goals through a mix of cost cutting, headcount reductions and making the business more efficient through new processes and technologies. In addition to those targets, Stewart also has set priorities to re-establish focus on its retail business, increase fleet business, including telematics, and ink high-profile business deals such as Goodyear's first launch in decades on a Ferrari sports car. "Goodyear Forward is just getting embedded into our DNA," Stewart said. "What's next for us is we are going to get aggressive about growth in retail and service. We are getting aggressive in growth in the high-end [tires]." Tires — Goodyear's main business — seem simple. Rubber is made into different shapes and treads, put on wheels and then put on a vehicle. They're literally where the rubber meets the road. But the process, material chemistry and production of tires continue to evolve. Goodyear has expanded its top-tier products to include massive tires for off-road vehicles such as the Jeep Wrangler and Ford Bronco, as well as the Tesla Cybertruck and large SUVs that feature 22-inch or 24-inch wheels such as the Cadillac Escalade. Such businesses are highly profitable for the company, which is investing an unspecified amount into a facility in Oklahoma to expand production by 10 million units annually and modernize the plant. "We will ensure we're running at the optimal level of output and efficiency, and we're running the products that will yield the highest opportunities for profitability this year," Stewart said last month on the company's quarterly call. In Asia–Pacific, where its newest plants are located, the company has been able to capitalize faster on such business. It increased its segment operating income by 37% last year to $277 million, with an operating margin of 11.4% — a juxtaposition from Western automakers with escalading problems in the region, specifically China. While its Asia–Pacific business is a tailwind at the moment, products from competitors and nearby nations are not. Similarly to how Chinese automakers have expanded outside their own country, tire manufacturers such as Sumitomo and Yokohama have been increasingly exporting products. Tires from that region have undercut Goodyear, as companies rushed to purchase them ahead of potential tariffs. Low-end imports outperformed the U.S. industry last year and grew 11%, CFO Christina Zamarro said during the company's quarterly earnings call. The company said low-cost imported tires are largely sourced from Southeast Asia, including from a number of countries that are either not subject to antidumping or countervailing duty tariffs. "As we look at the top line this past year, we've seen growth in the low-end imports impacting the consumer replacement industry in the U.S., Europe, as well Brazil," Stewart told investors. "The inflows at the low-end of the market over the last two years are unprecedented." Goodyear's the last major U.S. tire company: Its largest competitors globally are France-based Michelin; Bridgestone Corp., which is a subsidiary of a Japanese-based company; and German-based Continental. At Goodyear's headquarters, three floors of a historic building for the company that was built in 1916 continue to produce racing tires, most notably for NHRA professional classes and the top three series for NASCAR. The processes in this facility are traditional, with a lot of human interaction compared to newer plants with more automation like the company has at facilities in Luxembourg and China, and is expanding to the U.S. Down the road from the factory, which features wood floors similar to those in the factory in Detroit where Henry Ford started building the Model T in 1900s, is a different Goodyear. Walking into the nondescript building in the shadow of the headquarters is a glimpse into the future Stewart wants for the company. In the building is Goodyear's simulation machine, a multimillion investment that promises to cut research and development costs and time, while improving product profits. To be clear, no actual tires are used in the simulator and the "vehicle" cockpits — a hatchback and a pickup truck — are held up by hydraulics, surround by 270 degrees of screens. "The goal is to be able to evaluate and test tire designs and theories virtually before ever having to spend the money to build a mold or build the tire," said Patrick Renz, a senior engineer at Goodyear. "We're really using this now to win [automaker business]." Goodyear has worked with many of the major automakers on such virtual development, including Ferrari, according to Renz. He said the earlier in the development Goodyear can work with a company, the more impactful the virtual testing can be. Mahesh Kavaturu, Goodyear senior director of global performance and simulation technology, said such simulations, as well as AI, aim to transform Goodyear's processes. "We actually have a lot of capabilities on physical tire testing, and now we are getting into artificial intelligence, machine learning," he told CNBC in the company's "Innovation Center" that includes conceptual and unique products made by the company such as airless tires. "In Goodyear, [AI] is not a buzz word." On Wall Street, hype is building for Goodyear, but many investors remain on the sidelines waiting to see if the company's recent efforts under Goodyear Forward can be ingrained in the company as much as its blimps. Goodyear's stock is rated overweight with a target price of $11.47 a share, according to nine analysts compiled by FactSet. "The company has reported inconsistent levels of profit growth over the past several years. But, we believe that an inflection point developed with the reporting of fourth quarter 2024 results, which were much better than we expected," Argus analyst Bill Selesky said in a Feb. 14 investor note upgrading Goodyear to buy.
