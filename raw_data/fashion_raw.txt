TITLE: And This Year’s Unlikely Awards-Season Darling Is…Adam Sandler!
DATE: March 3, 2025
CONTENT:
There were plenty of surprises in store for viewers of the 2025 Oscars on Sunday night, from Anora’s sweep to Timothée Chalamet’s butter yellow leather Givenchy suit to Halle Berry re-creating her infamous kiss with Adrien Brody on the red carpet. One of the most welcome, however, came courtesy of Mr. Adam Sandler. During his opening monologue, Oscars host Conan O’Brien set up a bit that involved the legendary comic attending the year’s fanciest and most decadent Hollywood event in classic schmuck style—specifically, basketball shorts, sneakers, and a bright blue sweatshirt that I have to assume he borrowed from one of his daughters. After O’Brien accuses Sandler of being dressed like “a guy playing video poker at 2 a.m.” (fair and also…kind of hot? I may have problems), Sandler responds: “Did my snazzy gym shorts and fluffy sweatshirt offend you so much that you had to mock me in front my peers?” It wasn’t Sandler’s first time popping up during an awards show this year either. He was also roped into Nikki Glaser’s monologue at the Golden Globes in January, when she joked that Chalamet’s name “sounds like something Adam Sandler would say” before getting Sandler himself involved. (A nominee that night, he was dressed, for the record, in a perfectly respectable dark jacket.) I would probably find almost anything Sandler had to say at least a little bit funny (I still regularly think of him screaming the following line at his real-life daughter in the 2023 film You Are So Not Invited to My Bat Mitzvah: “That’s why we fought the Nazis? So you could have a mojito bar?”), but isn’t it just fun to see Adam Sandler—the Adam Sandler!—showing up in all his bumbling, weird-voiced, casually attired glory to stuffy awards shows? There’s really no one like the Sandman to help win a room over (and given how hard O’Brien and Glaser crushed as the hosts of their respective shows, maybe he’s also a good luck charm?)—even if he is in what one might generously term athleisure.

TITLE: Need a Present for a New Parent? A Month-by-Month Gift Guide for Baby’s First Year
DATE: March 9, 2025

Products are independently selected by our editors. We may earn an affiliate commission from links. When my first baby was born we were given so many adorable outfits for her, every combination of cashmere and lace and onesies with up-the-back-buttons that are nearly impossible to get on a squirming baby and I remember thinking, “gosh I hope she’s invited to a ton of fancy parties and black-tie galas in the first year of her life!” (spoiler alert: she was invited to exactly zero fancy parties and not one single gala). By the time my second daughter was born, I was actively requesting that anyone kind enough to gift us a present stay away from fancy baby clothes because I was by then a veteran at this game and knew that a truly great gift would be something a bit more useful to the new mom and dad. Here are a few ideas for baby gifts specific to surviving those first few precious months: The first month at home with your baby is usually spent in a delirious cycle of feeding, sleeping and about 1,000 hours of staring at this beautiful creature you created equally amazed and also appalled that it is yours forever. The best gifts at this time are so adorable that they distract you from the lack of sleep. I love to give a snuggly going-home-from-the-hospital outfit like this Oso and Me newborn set. Another fail safe option is a muslin set to swaddle the baby and a snuggly infant lounger to keep that bundle safe and sound! Zara star print baby sleeping bag ZARA Aden & Anais Essentials swaddles 4-pack AMAZON ADEN + ANAIS Snuggle Me infant lounger NORDSTROM Oso & Me Ready to Stroll bundle OSO & ME SAKS FIFTH AVENUE Two months is about the time babies are slowly getting into a nice evening routine: bath, bottle and (hopefully!) bed. Make sure they’re all ready for bathtime with the best clean baby products like these from Paloroma and cozy towels from Weezie. After bath it’s off to bed and arguably the best gift to give new parents is a few hours of unbroken sleep: enter the Snoo, an electronic crib that gently rocks baby to sleep so mom and dad don’t have to - priceless! Weezie Baby Shower bundle WEEZIE Paloroma The ABC pampering kit MAISONETTE SAKS FIFTH AVENUE Mon Ami elephant baby bath robe MAISONETTE Snoo Smart Sleeper baby bassinet AMAZON The first few outings with a new baby can be nerve wracking, wondering if you have all the right equipment, wondering if they’ll poop mid car journey, and wondering if you’ll wake the sleeping babe by lifting her from the car. A great option is Artipoppe’s beautiful baby carrier that is both comfortable and chic and I love to give Anya Hindmarch’s diaper changing kit—with handy pockets for everything you could possibly need, you can just pop it in your handbag and go! Any new mom would be thrilled with a portable bottle warmer, no more racing home to get a screaming baby some warm milk! Anya Hindmarch baby emergency kit NET-A-PORTER Zara faux shearling bodysuit ZARA Babymoov Moov N Feed portable bottle warmer NORDSTROM Artipoppe Zeitgeist tweed carrier ARTIPOPPE Six months is a huge milestone in baby land: many babies will be sitting up, hopefully sleeping through the night and are ready for their first bit of “real” (pureed) food. The Beaba Baby Cook makes pureeing baby concoctions a breeze and can turn any parent into a gourmet baby chef! These burp cloths come in so many great colors and is a mainstay in every stylish kitchen and don’t forget silicone bibs in complementary color schemes! Beaba Babycook Neo baby food maker NORDSTROM AMAZON POTTERY BARN Babeehive Goods silicone baby bib BUYBUY BABY Parker Baby Co. muslin cotton burp cloths set MAISONETTE  La Petite baby feeding dish set NORDSTROM The fun really kicks off once baby starts crawling! A playmat like this one from House of Noa is durable for picnics, crawling sessions or tummy time in or outdoors and Lovevery’s toy kits are designed for each stage of development to keep them busy. Don’t forget a cozy playsuit to keep those knees covered for crawling practice! House of Noa Little Nomad play mat THE HOUSE OF NOA Wonder & Wise rainbow nester stacker MAISONETTE Lovevery The Babbler play kit AMAZON Willkie's soft gauze baby jumpsuit WILLKIE'S Hooray, your baby is one! Mostly this is a celebration of the parents for surviving the first year so go all out: party outfit like this one from La Coqueta, tons of balloons and, of course, baby’s first bite of sugar in that delicious cake! A keepsake box is the perfect gift for nostalgic parents to save all those tiny little outfits and mementos from baby’s first year. The single greatest gift my girls were given was a Tonie box: an electronic story box that reads endless stories to them, perfect for the parent who simply can’t stomach another rendition of The Very Hungry Caterpillar for the nine hundredth time. I love to give a fabulous (perhaps impractical) but fun pair of shoes for a baby’s first birthday; if they haven’t taken those precious first steps yet they will soon! Meminio large memory box MEMINIO Tonies Toniebox audio player Disney set AMAZON La Coqueta Rosaura baby girl set LA COQUETA Stella McCartney fringe cowboy boots MYTHERESA Walking, talking, climbing everything – the eighteen month mark is when babies are constantly on the go! Give them lots to do to keep them active like a balance bike scooter and a stroller-slash-trolley and of course, a pair of sneakers for those very busy days. To help wind down at the end of the day I love customizable books from Librio for a keepsake book that kids will remember for years to come.

TITLE: The White Lotus Stars Check Into Fashion Month
DATE: March 9, 2025
CONTENT:
If you’re not currently watching season three of The White Lotus, what are you even doing with your life? Now several episodes in, and the hit HBO show from Mike White is already a delicious television spectacle that should not be missed—zeroing in on a new group of rich, chic, and obnoxious hotel guests that are up to no good in Thailand. Even if you aren’t up to speed on this season, you've likely clocked that it’s the buzziest series of the moment. So, it was only natural that the star-studded cast were also front and center at the fall 2025 shows during Fashion Month. Most recently at Paris Fashion Week, Parker Posey sat front row at Valentino, while Leslie Bibb was spotted at Balmain. Sarah Catherine Hook also sat front row of Hermès, dressing in a sheer, fuchsia zipper crop top and skirt co-ord set by the brand. Hook, who first came on the radar through her role as Juliette Fairmont in the Netflix teen series First Kill and in the TV reboot of Cruel Intentions, plays Piper. She’s the daughter of Victoria (Posey) and Timothy Ratliff (Jason Isaacs), with two brothers (Patrick Schwarzenegger and Sam Nivola). (Avec a whole lot of strange sibling chemistry that’s yet to be fully unpicked). This is the 29-year-old’s first foray into the French fashion front rows—what better way to center your jaunt to the City of Light than at the storied French maison’s fall 2025 show? Back a week previous in Milan, the Gucci show saw not one but two White Lotus stars in the front row. Posey, who plays a comically pilled-up mom, graced the show in a hunter-green peacoat, black dress pants, and staggering burgundy platform heels. Sam Nivola, who plays her teenage son, also attended the show alongside girlfriend Iris Apatow; He wore a dressy brown cardigan sweater, shirt and tie, and classic dress pants. The White Lotus cast isn’t just making appearances in their prime VIP seats, either; some are even making cameos on the runways, too. At London Fashion Week, Jason Isaacs, who plays the stressed-out dad and husband to Posey’s character, walked in Daniel Lee’s fall 2025 Burberry show. His chic double-breasted coat and wool scarf? They were a far cry from the easy-breezy, tropical-themed shirts that he wears on the show. Star gazing at all the big shows this season, you were bound to see a White Lotus actor in the mix—either on or off the catwalk. No sign of Leslie Bibb, Carrie Coon, and Michelle Monaghan making a wild girls trip out of fashion month so far—just like their characters do on the show—but we still have time. Jason Isaacs walks the Burberry fall 2025 show

TITLE: 7 Movies About the Sex Work Industry to Watch After Anora
DATE: March 4, 2025
CONTENT:
“I want to thank the sex worker community. They have shared their stories. They have shared their life experience with me over the years. My deepest respect. Thank you; I share this with you.” So said filmmaker Sean Baker (Tangerine, The Florida Project) onstage at the 2025 Oscars on Sunday, as he collected the best original screenplay award for his film Anora. While Baker’s portrait of Ani—a Brighton Beach stripper who, struggling to make ends meet, impulsively marries the son of a Russian oligarch—has drawn mixed reviews from critics familiar with strip-club culture and sex work more broadly, the fanfare around Anora shows no signs of slowing down, especially after its five Oscar wins (including one for star Mikey Madison). Curious to learn more about the community it depicts? Here are seven films, both documentary and narrative, that delve deep into the personal and cultural ramifications of sex work. This moving documentary, which premiered at Sundance in 2023, spotlights the stories of Black and Latina trans women who engaged in sex work in New York City’s Meatpacking District during the 1980s and 1990s—among them Amanda Milan, who was attacked and killed by two men in Times Square in 2000. A final shot of G.L.I.T.S. founder Ceyenne Doroshow speaking at the Brooklyn Liberation rally in 2020 underscores how the fight for trans rights and visibility rages on. It’s difficult to watch this groundbreaking documentary about the lives of four Black trans sex workers without mourning Koko Da Doll, one of the film’s stars, whose 2023 murder in Atlanta has been investigated as a hate crime. While Koko’s death was emblematic of the all-too-real danger that Black trans women consistently face, Kokomo City (which was dedicated to her) keeps the focus where it should be: on the life she lived. Not every film can trace its origins back to a viral Twitter thread, but that’s exactly how Zola came to be. Written by Jeremy O. Harris and director Bravo, and starring Taylour Paige as Zola, a Detroit waitress and part-time stripper who joins Riley Keough’s Stefani on a road trip to a strip club in Tampa, the movie crackles with life, imbuing an age-old story (women stripping and engaging in sex work in order to survive and hopefully achieve their dreams) with both humor and humanity. If you’ve never seen Jennifer Lopez strip to the Fiona Apple song “Criminal,” you need to watch Hustlers immediately. Immaculate pole routines aside, this film, about the enterprising spirit of a group of New York strippers who come together to fleece their clueless, often boorish Wall Street–bro clients, is innovative, funny, and replete with A+ stripper style. This film, set in an unnamed former Soviet republic, is most definitely not for the faint of heart, but its story of a teenage girl named Lilya who encounters frequent sexual and physical violence after turning to sex work sadly reflects some of the very real dangers that many in the sex industry face at the margins of a still whore-phobic society. If you’ve ever wondered what sex workers talk about in their off-hours, this is the movie for you. Borden’s indie film takes place primarily in a Manhattan brothel, where Molly—a Yale grad doing sex work to support herself and her girlfriend—spends time with her coworkers and dreams of changing her life. Working Girls was partially inspired by some of the women who worked on Borden’s first film, 1983’s Born in Flames. Nothing much happens in this landmark 1975 Akerman film, and that’s exactly what makes it so revolutionary. The movie follows Jeanne Dielman, the widowed mother of a teenage son who engages in sex work to keep her family afloat. She treats her afternoon meetings with clients no differently than cooking, cleaning, or any of the other mundane activities associated with feminized labor that make up her day. (Note that when I say “nothing much happens,” I am setting aside the film’s explosive ending, but no spoilers; watch it for yourself and see.)

TITLE: Meghan Markle Models Power Lunch Style While Out With Serena Williams
DATE: March 4, 2025
CONTENT:
Last weekend, ahead of the much-anticipated launch of her new show, With Love, Meghan, Meghan Markle joined Serena Williams for a celebratory lunch in Montecito. While Markle goes full “lifestyle guru” in her Netflix show, she traded her prim Emilia Wickstead dresses for a power-lunch look. (She contains multitides!) The Duchess of Sussex opted for a menswear-inspired set from La Ligne, wearing a relaxed navy button-up with ivory pinstripes and matching wide-legged trousers. While the oversized, flowing set befits the beachside town, Markle added a pair of strappy sandals to give the outfit a vibe that was less return to office, more friendly business kiki. Markle’s accessories brought a feminine touch to her outfit. On her arm, she carried a black leather Loro Piana Loom bag. She added a pair of oversized black square sunglasses and a smattering of jewelry, including a trendy pinkie ring. Williams, for her part, embraced the color of the season in a long-sleeve burgundy dress, which she paired with sporty white sneakers. With companies enforcing a return to office, allow Meghan Markle to model a work-friendly outfit. Or at least something to wear to your next business lunch.

TITLE: From the Archives: A “Complete Unknown” Haider Ackermann First Appears in Vogue
DATE: March 9, 2025
CONTENT:
The Belgian designer-making factory has yet another sensation to add to its ever-expanding cast of the cool and the credible. It scarcely seems possible, but it's true. Haider Ackermann's supersonic fairy tale goes like this: At 32, a complete unknown, he materializes on the Paris stage in March with an almost disconcertingly accomplished first collection, all lean-lined, elegant austerity, textured with arresting detail. The minute the show ends, gossip starts about a rare new sensibility, someone with incredible maturity. Buyers crowd in, crying words like sophisticated and beautiful. "I took it as a compliment," says Ackermann, "because I wanted to do something realistic and wearable. So when people said it looks very much grown-up, it was good." One minute later, shazam! A certain blonde from Milan appears at his side, lifts her magic wand, and says, "Come, Haider. I want to make you the new designer at Ruffo Research!" Or words to that effect. Joy Yaffe, director of Ruffo, the giant Italian luxury-leather group, has a reputation as a godmother of young designers: Catch her eye, and you'll be on the runway in Milan, thrust overnight in- to the spotlight. "When I walked into his showroom, I was immediately captivated," Yaffe says. "Even though Haider had done only one collection, I had a feeling of confidence in him. He's in sync with what today's woman wants—something timeless, simple but sophisticated." Being selected for Ruffo Research is like an indie band's getting a two-album deal from a major label. Over the past five years a succession of about-to-make-it talent has trooped through Ruffo Research's Tuscan studios. Antonio Berardi, Veronique Branquinho, Raf Simons, A.F. Vandevorst, Sophia Kokosalaki, and Alexandre Matthieu have all been there. For Ruffo, the announce- ment of the next newcomer is a case of the more obscure, the better. So who is Haider Ackermann? A resident of Antwerp who was born in Colombia, adopted by French parents, and educated all over the world before gravitating to Antwerp's Royal Academy. "My father is from Alsace, which is why my name sounds German," he explains. "He works for Amnesty International, so we traveled around when I was a child. I did my baccalaureate in the Netherlands and then decided I wanted to study fashion." After he left, interned with Galliano, and did a stint with Wim Neels, it took him a while to pluck up the courage to do his own collection. "I left the academy after the third year for financial reasons. It was hard. I took on three freelance design jobs and worked behind bars, in clubs. I was always thinking of doing it, but I doubted myself." But here, a typically Belgian twist in the story: Ackermann took his sketches to show a friend, designer Raf Simons, who reacted with typical Antwerpian solidarity. "Raf was like, 'You have to do it!'" remembers Ackermann. "The same day, he called his press agent and his fabric manufacturer—and then everything went very fast. It was scary. It was a big risk." Haider moved into an airy warehouse, which was once used by Victorian seamstresses, and worked at realizing clothes to fit his idea of femininity. “I don't like it when you put something on a woman and it looks like decoration. I don't think that's respectful.” His own second collection, to be shown in October, will continue with his attenuated line and handmade details. And for Ruffo Research's luxe leather, the sky's the limit. "We're seeing what we can do with smocking, weaving leather with studs in it, destroying leather, perforating it," he says excitedly, promising draped silky-soft suede dresses and armfuls of leather jewelry. Meanwhile, Yaffe, who says she loves Ackermann's idea of casting his show with a mix of models of all ages, looks forward to launching her new protege into the world. "Like all the others, he's getting carte blanche," she says.

TITLE: 7 Chefs on the Women Who Shaped Their Culinary Voices
DATE: March 8, 2025
CONTENT:
Products are independently selected by our editors. We may earn an affiliate commission from links. Is the world of hospitality finally ready for its #MeToo moment? In the UK, a recent letter from 70 women chefs called upon the restaurant industry to recognize both the blatant and more insidious forms of sexism within its midst, leading to widespread media coverage. Sally Abé of The Pem, Tiella’s Dara Klein, and Poppy O’Toole were among the list of women “exhausted by an industry so systematically flawed that we struggle to see ourselves within it.” Professional kitchens have long been marred by inflated egos and aggression, an environment that makes it all the more difficult for women to break through and thrive. Yet there are plenty of communities and figures across the world making their pan-cultural kitchens more diverse, inclusive, and joyful spaces. For the seven chefs we spoke to this International Women’s Day, it felt like a moment to celebrate—whether a mom’s late night acts of love with a warm and comforting home-cooked meal, lessons passed from one female chef to another in the kitchen, or authentic recipes shared between generations of women. Here, we have Paris Rosina: a London-based chef, creative, former dinner lady, and former Dusty Knuckle head chef; Paris’ travelling Afro-vegan chef Glory Kabe; Tokyo-based cook Millie Tsukagoshi Lagares, whose forthcoming debut cookbook Umai is a resplendent, nourishing journey through Japanese cuisine; beloved London restaurant Cafe Deco’s head chef Anna Tobias who steers its fresh, innovative, seasonal approach; Rahel Stephanie, the chef behind Indonesian supper club Spoons; New York-based chef, stylist and culinary artist Thu Buser who celebrates and reimagines Viet cuisine; and Savannah Hagendijk, head chef at Amsterdam’s Michelin-starred Restaurant de Kas, currently cooking up a storm over the grills at Soho’s Firebird. Below, these seven chefs and cooks share the stories of the women who shaped their cooking. “I come from a working class family, where we didn’t eat anything extravagant growing up. I grew up watching Nigella, Fanny, and Delia, and I was obsessed with the Two Fat Ladies from a young age. I am so lucky to have such strong women around me. Rebecca Oliver of Dusty Knuckle really gave me some much needed nurturing during my career there. I am not sure where I would be without her. Melek Erdel is my dear friend, and the first person outside of my kitchen team I connected with in food. Holly Chaves, Marie Mitchell, Rosie French, Panayiota Soutis, Caitlin Isola, Holly Cochrane. In my teens and early 20s, I worked in many all-male kitchens. I’ve been both bullied and sexually assaulted by chefs and front of house managers. In the last few years, a fridge repair man rubbed my shoulder and said ‘make us a cup of tea love'. With that said, I have chosen to remove myself from environments like this—I think that says it all. I do know lots of people now thriving in their workplaces, however, would I also say that a lot of these places—not all—are queer and female led spaces? Probably yes.” “My mother was a huge influence in my career as a chef. She wasn’t a professional cook, but the way she approached food with love, care, and deep cultural roots shaped how I see cooking today. She taught me that food is more than just nourishment—it’s a story, a connection to identity and history. Her presence in the kitchen was powerful and inspiring, and I carry that essence in my work today. I deeply admire chefs like chef Fatmata Binta and chef Adefila Adenike Abisola for their dedication to breaking barriers and creating spaces where culinary traditions from diverse backgrounds are celebrated. I believe the industry is evolving, but there is still work to be done in making kitchens more inclusive and equitable. The key is fostering environments where women, especially women of color, feel empowered to lead, innovate, and be recognized for their contributions. A career highlight for me was working with Alessandra Montagne for Cannes Film Festival and highlighting our cultures during one of the biggest events in the world. I had the chance to push the boundaries of food and storytelling—moments like these remind me why I do what I do.” “Food was always something I felt strongly about as I grew up with a Japanese mum—this meant food and cooking was always at the forefront of our daily lives. The care, culture, and passion that my mum had towards food was incredibly inspiring, as well as her having a creative job where she got to travel the world. I’m a big fan of authors and chefs like Ixta Belfrage who make use of fusion, doing things that are fun and exciting, drawing inspiration from all over the world—it’s definitely something I strive towards in the way that I cook. Kelly Pochyba, for home cooking that is simple, beautiful, and homey. The way she writes is so cozy, and feels like I’m reading a letter from a penpal. I have a good friend, Alexa Fahlman, who moved to Tokyo recently from a Chinese-Canadian background and we both have so much fun looking toward Japanese ingredients, traveling, eating out, and discussing dishes. All the women in the Ottolenghi Test Kitchen have always created a safe space in food. Where they draw influence from is always so fascinating: Milli Taylor, Katja Tausig, Noor Murad, Chaya Maya.” “I found women’s voices in cookery literature have often guided my way—starting with some of the classic writers like Julia Child, Elizabeth David, and Jane Grigson and then Gabrielle Hamilton and Judy Rogers. Elizabeth David had such a strong voice that I connected to. Grigson and Child gave excellent instruction and were formative. With Rogers and Hamilton, I really value their attention to precision, which feels essential to me as a chef who focuses on simple food. There are countless women running incredible kitchens. Laura Jackson of Towpath, Dara Klein of Tiella, Simona di Dio of Bottega Caruso, and Sophia Massarella of Polentina are just a few from my own generation. Each of these chefs is creating beautiful, thoughtful, and spirited food that has a strong sense of self and character. Working for Margot Henderson at Rochelle Canteen was a major highlight for me. It was during my time there that I felt like I truly found my culinary voice. Margot was incredibly generous in allowing me to explore and develop that by giving me the opportunity to write restaurant menus. She has such a distinct aesthetic, not just in her food, but also in how she hosts and creates an atmosphere. There’s a unique mix of style, ease, generosity, and an effortless sense of cool. My trajectory has been very chosen in the sense that I have mostly worked for women and so my environment has usually felt very gender balanced. I do think that hospitality is moving in the right direction, but I believe there is still a lot of room for improvement in terms of making the culture more positive—from having better conversations around mental health to just ensuring that every member of every team feels like they're in a safe and happy environment. These should be the basic standards, but I think there’s still a little way to go to make them the norm.” “I didn’t grow up in a household where cooking was a big part of our daily life, and I wasn’t particularly close to the matriarchs in my family. After my grandmother passed away two years ago, I felt this pull to connect with my great-aunt, Oma Chris. She’s always been one of the most talented cooks I know, effortlessly making dishes that hold deep meaning for our family. Learning from her has been more than just about the recipes—it’s about understanding how food carries memory, how it becomes a thread that ties people together. That’s something I carry into my own practice: Using food as a way to gather, to create moments that feel intimate and grounding, even for those who might not have grown up with that kind of connection. I didn’t take the traditional route into food—I never went to culinary school, and I kind of stumbled into it organically. But I wouldn’t be where I am today without the women in this industry who have been so generous in sharing knowledge, opportunities, and support. There’s this real sense of community among women in hospitality, and that’s been invaluable. It’s not just about mentorship in the traditional sense—it’s about exchanging ideas, lifting each other up, and making space where space wasn’t always given to us. Being a self-taught woman of color in a male-dominated industry comes with its challenges. I’ve been underestimated plenty of times, but I’ve learned to use those moments to shift perceptions. There’s always this element of surprise when people realize what I bring to the table—like they didn’t expect it. But I love that. It’s a reminder that skill, creativity, and passion don’t fit into a single mold, and that the industry is evolving beyond outdated ideas of who gets to take up space in kitchens. That’s something I try to pass forward, too—making sure other women, especially those who don’t fit the usual industry narrative, feel seen and valued. There’s been progress, but there’s still a long way to go, especially when it comes to intersectionality. The conversation around inclusivity often centers on gender, but there’s still so much work to be done for trans women, non-binary folks, and people of color in these spaces. It’s not just about opening doors—it’s about actively dismantling the structures that have kept certain people out in the first place. That means rethinking hiring practices, leadership dynamics, and even the way kitchens function on a day-to-day level. True inclusivity isn’t just about who’s in the room, but whether they feel safe, supported, and empowered to thrive.” “As a little girl, I used to run around and cause chaos at my mom’s restaurant, built into the side of our house. There was just something so enticing about the activity and energy of the restaurant, and somehow my mom always found the time to put little artistic touches on each dish. Sometimes it was carrots carved into little roses, other times it was watermelons cut into fractal patterns; but there was always an element of beauty. She did her best to dissuade me from becoming a chef, but it was too late! Being a woman in Vietnam in my mother’s era meant you never had the luxury of pursuing your passion. Growing up in Vietnam, there was not a culture of learning and recognizing chefs, so it was a big surprise when I found that it was possible to be a household name by making food in the US. The first person I learned about was Julia Childs, and I became obsessed with the idea that a woman could approach cooking with this kind of ferocity. Back home, there was more of a local cult following around neighborhood cooks who had mastered a particular dish, and I remember, outside the alley of my house, there was this incredible wonton soup woman named An who was already up and preparing when I was just coming home from partying all night! If I have learned anything from these women, it is that there is no such thing as working too hard or diving too deep into making amazing food for other people. I host my own pop up series and hire a team of chefs to work with me—I know I need to live the principles I’d like to see in the industry. As a Vietnamese chef, I love gathering people who are less familiar with my cuisine, no matter what background they come from, who are really inspired to learn. I am aware this is not always the case and people are brought in to fit a pre-determined role rather than giving them room to express their own style and capabilities. I think that pop-ups can lead the wave of change in this area since we have less demand to meet day to day challenges and can take a more flexible approach to building a kitchen culture. I had seen a huge surge in the importance of ethnic people making and styling our own food for the camera, which is a welcome change.” “I have sadly never worked for a female head chef. I have worked with good male chefs, but unfortunately there were few female chefs in the places where I worked at the start of my career. My sister has been a great example to me when it comes to perseverance and willpower—she opened her own business when she was quite young, and while it was not always easy, she persevered and did it anyway. I find Margot Jansens’s cooking style and vision very inspiring, and what Mari Maris does with vegetables is incredibly cool. I have been given many opportunities to develop myself into who I am today through Jos Timmer and Wim de Beer. It is inspiring to see that they want to put young women and men forward at De Kas, and put them in the picture, but it is also really nice that, despite the fact that there are far too few women working in the kitchen, I have never encountered problems with it at De Kas. I have certainly seen kitchens become more diverse in recent years—there were even days when we had more women than men in the kitchen at De Kas. It does not matter to me what the exact distribution is, as long as women can do what they want and that everyone can feel at home in the kitchen, regardless of gender or background.”

TITLE: Hermès’s Subtle Smoky Eye Is the Easiest New Season Beauty Look To Try at Home
DATE: March 9, 2025

Products are independently selected by our editors. We may earn an affiliate commission from links. The Hermès woman is too busy to look back. That’s what Gregoris Pyrpylis, creative director of Hermès Beauty, tells Vogue backstage at the fall 2025 show. “This season, she doesn’t have time to look around,” Pyrpylis says. “She’s focused, she’s determined, she’s moving forward.” In practical terms, that meant last season’s fresh-faced makeup was replaced by subtly smoky eyes on models with 100-yard stares at the Garde Républicaine. Pyrpylis’s smoky-eye technique. It’s a look anyone can recreate at home, Pyrpylis says, explaining that he used a trio of Trait d’Hermès Eye Pencils in Brun Écorce, Brun Bistre, and Gris Graphite to achieve the look. “We smoked out the inner and outer corners for more of a structured eye, but left the middle clear save for some translucent powder, which stops the pigments smudging together.” “We have warm and cool browns, we have slate grey and deep black – so all the colors are kind of muted tones lifted from the collection,” Pyrpylis told Vogue. Models’ skin, meanwhile, was given a matte texture (a trend this season) inspired by the wool felt that creative director Nadège Vanhée frequently deploys for the house’s signature horse blankets and coats, while lips were swept with Silky Lipstick Shine in muted shades—particularly Brun Sellier, which simply “looks like a shadow” and works on all skin tones. Nails, too, were kept simple, with Anatole Rainey developing a “wet-look” manicure using a simple coat of Rose Porcelaine Nail Polish. The autumn/winter 2025 Hermès girl is “too cool to wear a colored polish”, jokes Rainey. As for the hair, stylist Gary Gill coaxed it back into hair falls and low ponytails with L’Oreal Infinium Pure Hairspray and his favorite Japanese brush. He was loosely inspired, he said, by horses’ tails—but also by the grit of the collection. It speaks to the “leather dandy” and the equestrian biker fits creative director Nadège Vanhée was sending down the runway. “It’s really about being assertive. It’s about strength. About being sexy and sophisticated—and just owning it,” Vanhée told Vogue. “It looked really tough to me,” Gill says, reflecting on the boldly assured hair looks. “So I just wanted to make sure we kept that toughness.”

TITLE: Rihanna Dresses Cozy and Classic to Solo Dine at Her Favorite Restaurant
DATE: March 9, 2025
CONTENT:
Rihanna stays faithful to her favorites, from the Housewives (RHONY’s Jenna Lyons), to fashion (Louis Vuitton, Fendi, Alaïa), and gargantuan headgear. That’s also true of restaurants, as a frequent patron of Giorgio Baldi in Santa Monica, California—somewhere she’s been said to eat up to three times a week, and allegedly never straying from ordering the classics like ravioli with ricotta cheese, gnocchi, and spaghetti pomodoro with basil. The Italian establishment, visited by a broad spectrum of celebrities from Taylor Swift to Tom Hanks and Kim Kardashian, reopened its doors again this week following the Palisades fire which forced its closure in January. Of course, the ANTI singer was going to turn out and support, even solo. The walk from Mercedes to Giorgio Baldi’s cloistered front door has become something of a runway for Rhianna over the years. This evening was no different, with Rhianna opting for a cozy, classic look. She wore an oversized black and navy wool coat, with pointed black boots and a Fendi mini bag with a furry charm. Rhi also wore her hair in an effortlessly chic slickback ponytail. The charm-adorned Fendi was the focal point of the look—one of many from the Italian label in her arsenal of bags. Often, she’ll be seen toting some ultra-rare archive versions and the classic Baguette in an array of colors. Over the years, outfits for nights at Giorgio Baldi have been just as varied and A-list appropriate, even for a low-key night of pasta. From Acne Studios sweater dresses to fluffy bombers and denim, and on a more high-fashion feeling night, a leopard print onsie with Bottega Veneta accessories. On most occasions, she’s with her partner A$AP Rocky, wearing fits in step with each other. Rocky’s jaunt to Paris Fashion Week won’t stop Rihanna getting her ravioli though. Now Giorgio Baldi is back open again, Rihanna can get back to ordering half-portions of all her favorite pasta dishes, and the restaurant is truly her runway.
