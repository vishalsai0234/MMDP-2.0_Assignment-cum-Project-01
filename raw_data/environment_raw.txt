TITLE: Canada's beloved outdoor ice rinks are melting away
DATE: 
CONTENT:
Over the past 50 years, the length of skating season in some parts of Canada decreased by a third. By 2050, some regions may not see one at all. Every year, the Rideau Canal in Ottawa, Canada is transformed into the world’s largest, natural ice skating rink. The skateway, which winds through the country’s capital city for over four miles, has welcomed locals and tourists for over fifty years. It is a place where kids gather to play, where elderly couples share a quiet waltz, where men and women commute to work in the early hours of the morning. It also happens to be the place I first learnt to skate. This week, the skateway welcomed its first skaters of the season, after a cold snap descended upon the capital, turning the canal into a solid sheet of ice. Skaters flocked to the rink, glided across the ice and enjoyed a traditional BeaverTail snack. It was a joyous day that skaters worried wouldn’t come. “Skating on the canal has become so unreliable lately,” says Chris Cochrane, a 38-year-old resident of Ottawa, referencing the warmer weather. “It's been challenging to keep the tradition alive.” In Canada, skating on natural rinks is a way of life. Each winter, when the local rivers, lakes, and streams freeze over, Canadians of all ages glide across the ice, playing hockey and figure skating, partaking in a tradition as old as Canada itself. The International Ice hockey Federation estimates that there are roughly 5,000 outdoor ice rinks across Canada today, the most of any country worldwide after Russia. Though it is believed that ice skating originated in Scandinavia over 2,000 years ago, Canada has its own rich skating history. The Iroquois used to skate by tying animal bones to their footwear long before colonizers arrived on the country’s shores. Archives indicate that in Acadia, French settlers were skating as early as 1604. By the mid-19th century, Canada built its first outdoor commercial rink in Montreal, cementing skating as a central part of Canadian life. As winters warm because of climate change, however, Canadians' beloved tradition is melting away. Last year, Ottawa saw its shortest skating season, with the Rideau Canal Skateway opening for a mere ten days due to wet and warm weather. The previous year was even worse: the rink never opened at all. Across the country, skating rinks are facing a similar fate. For rinks to be safe, there must be at least ten to fifteen consecutive days of weather below 14℉. These conditions, which used to be common in Canada, are increasingly ephemeral. A study found that from 1951 to 2005, there was a 20 to 30 percent decrease in the length of skating seasons, with the biggest drops in Alberta, eastern British Columbia and the southern Prairie regions. By mid-century, researchers believe the number of viable skating days in Montreal could decrease to zero. For Canadians, the disappearance of natural rinks doesn’t just mean losing a recreational activity—it means losing a community. Mervyn Horgan and Saara Liinamaa, who spent 100 hours studying social interactions at outdoor skating rinks in Canada’s 25 largest cities, found they constitute a “distinctive kind of public space” in the country, that has the possibility of forging community ties in a way few other activities can. “These rinks are really points of community building and connection,” says Liinamaa. “It’s a point of contact where a whole neighborhood comes together to create, maintain, and share this sheet of ice. ” Because many public rinks are free, skating provides a rare opportunity for people who come from different ethnic, gender, generational, and class divides, to meet and mingle, offering a steadying hand to a wobbly stranger. “Ottawa has become such a fragmented community,” says Cochrane. “Skating on the canal is one of the few activities that brings people from all around.” Horgan and Liinamaa's research affirmed this, finding that ice rinks are a rare place where community ties are created and solidified. “Skating, as a lifestyle, as a practice, as a ritual, is very strong in our Canadian winterscape,” says Liinamaa. “It’s a key winter ritual. It is part of family histories and practices in important ways.” I know this personally. Skating, in many respects, has shaped my family history. My grand-father was a machinist by day, volunteer ice-hockey coach by night, skating below the moonlight at his local rink in suburban Montreal. When he died, his former players filled the pews at the funeral. He passed along his love of skating to my mom: as a teenager, she spent her Saturday nights working at the ice rink concession stand. When she became a mother, she let my sister and I skip school to spend “just a few more minutes!” doing laps at the rink. The most important moments of my youth happened on skates: birthdays, christmases, dates and accidents. The skating rink has been the stage where our lives have unfolded. It has witnessed us across generations. Every Christmas, my sister and I sing Canadian singer-songwriter Joni Mitchell’s iconic winter song, River, where she famously wishes she had a river she could skate away on. I always thought the river was just a metaphor about longing for a person, a time, or a place, that is now long gone. I never thought it, too, could disappear. In response to melting ice rinks, a citizen science initiative, RinkWatch has formed. It relies on data submitted by local skating enthusiasts to monitor long term weather conditions. The results are not promising: Rink Watch researchers estimate that based on current data, the number of skating days could decline by 34 percent in Toronto and 19 percent in Calgary by 2090. “Today, you are seeing people’s actual childhoods disappearing,” says Liinamaa. “I am deeply, and acutely sad about what’s going to happen.” RinkWatch, however, is doing what it can to keep skating traditions alive: it has created an interactive map of skating rinks, which helps connect people with rinks that are deemed safe enough to skate on. While Liinamaa finds these kinds of initiatives heartening, she remains concerned. “Communities are of course innovative and resilient,” she says. “But what do you do with a slushy park?”

TITLE: Sound waves and sea creatures
DATE: 
CONTENT:
Thousands of marine species from microscopic zooplankton to the largest cetaceans rely on sound for survival and many have evolved unique oral and aural adaptations. Understanding them better could help us reduce the impact of anthropogenic noises from shipping and marine industry. Humans tend to associate the ocean with silence. Yet water doesn’t mute sound, but amplifies it. Sound waves travel 4.3 times faster underwater than they do in the air and they retain their energy for much longer. Many sea creatures depend on sound, and have evolved complex systems of communication that they use for connection, reproduction, territorial assertion and survival. But over the last few decades, the ocean has become an increasingly noisy place thanks to us humans—shipping noise, industry and seismic air guns searching for oil and gas have a devastating impact on many sea creatures that rely on sound for survival. Through the SEA BEYOND educational program—which benefits from 1% of the proceeds from the Prada Re-Nylon for SEA BEYOND Collection—Prada Group and UNESCO-IOC are bringing the underwater world into classrooms around the world and helping to foster a deeper understanding and love for our planet’s marine ecosystems—including the acoustic environment. Here are five marine animals that display unique aural adaptations that help them to thrive underwater. Because they spend a great deal of their time at depths of between 1,000 and 10,000 feet (300-3,000 meters) where little or no sunlight can penetrate, sperm whales rely on echolocation to navigate. This marine giant emits powerful vocalizations in the form of rhythmic clicks that bounce off underwater objects so that the whale can create a highly detailed sonic map of the surrounding ocean topography. These clicks are capable of traversing great distances and are useful for detecting prey and communicating with pod members that may be hundreds of miles away. They pack a punch, too, reaching up to 230 decibels—enough to stun prey like squid or sharks. This echolocation ability is highly evolved—a sperm whale is able to single out a small ray from the kaleidoscope of ocean sounds surrounding it with surgical accuracy in total darkness. Like sperm whales, sea lions are highly vocal animals, but they operate in a very different ecosystem. Many sea lion populations are found in the dense kelp forests that form a great highway along the Pacific coast of the Americas. Here, they use sound to keep track of each other, socialize, navigate and lay claim to territory. Indeed, sea lions are among the noisiest of sea creatures, letting out barks, grunts, growls, whines and clicks that all carry meaning. Male sea lions, for example, generate distinctive territorial calls that resonate through the marine environment, creating underwater sound maps that define breeding and hunting territories. These calls can extend several kilometers, allowing sea lions to establish precise acoustic boundaries without resorting to physical confrontation. Mother sea lions communicate with their pups using highly individualized calls that are instantly recognizable—an invaluable tool for keeping track of errant offspring in the thick kelp forests, or when joining hunting migrations. Pistol shrimps may be small, averaging around 1.5 inches (4cm) in length, but to say that these little crustaceans punch above their weight is an understatement. The pistol shrimp possesses one outsized claw, which it can snap closed at close to 65 miles per hour (100kmh). This creates what’s called a “cavitation bubble” that can generate an extraordinary 218 decibels of sound when it collapses under the pressure of the water surrounding it. For a split second, this sonic blast heats the water close to the bubble to temperatures in excess of 8,000 degrees Fahrenheit (4,427 degrees Celsius)—four times hotter than lava. It’s a pretty handy talent when it comes to stunning or killing prey, such as small fish and invertebrates, deterring predators or competitors from entering its territory, as well as for communicating with other pistol shrimps. Secreting itself among rocks on the seabed and in sheltered coastal habitats, at first glance the oyster toadfish looks like a nondescript blob, but it’s actually quite the lothario. Male toadfish woo potential mates using a medley of mating calls that they generate by vibrating their swim bladders—sort of like an underwater bagpipe. During the breeding season, the males use their muscles to rapidly contract their swim bladders, generating what’s often described as a “boat whistle” sound at frequencies that are capable of traversing significant distances in search of a female. Each vocalization is distinctive, and marine researchers are able to identify individual fish by their unique sonic signatures. Besides these love songs, toadfish also use acoustic signals to ward off competitors, socialize and establish territory. The plainfin midshipman is a nocturnal species of toadfish that has evolved a highly sensitized auditory adaptation. Native to the Pacific coast of the US, this unassuming bottom-dweller has an acute sense of hearing that is keyed into specific frequencies and even changes depending on the season. Their delicate inner ear structures—called the utricle and saccule—are fine-tuned to detect specific sound signatures. These sensory organs are lined with microscopic hair cells that translate mechanical vibrations into neural signals, and are highly developed. What’s more, female plainfins are better able to hear quieter sounds in the summer thanks to changes in dopamine levels in their inner ear—a form of auditory plasticity that allows them to detect and choose mates. Marine ecosystems provide critical life support to countless unique species—including humans. To protect them, we need to understand them. This is one of the key reasons Prada is channeling 1% of proceeds from its regenerated Re-Nylon collection to encourage ocean literacy and research initiatives that help preserve our ocean.

TITLE: The 'least spectacular' of the Great Lakes is a devastating snow machine
DATE: 
CONTENT:
Lake Erie's devastating lake-effect snow storms can smother communities with collapsed roofs and impassable roads. Could these storms get worse? Ashtabula, Ohio — Jim Timonere has been watching and waiting for Lake Erie to freeze over, just to catch a break. It’s been a brutal winter for communities along the southeastern and eastern shores of Lake Erie that spans Ohio, Pennsylvania, and New York. Last Thanksgiving Day weekend, the region was paralyzed by a “historic” storm that saw almost six feet of snow upend life across hundreds of miles. “When I woke up at 3 a.m. to check the snowfall I thought: ‘no big deal,’” he recalls. “Two hours later, I looked outside, and it was: ‘Oh, my god.’ We got feet of snow in a matter of hours.” Roofs of more than a dozen structures in Ashtabula collapsed, including the local high school’s, forcing hundreds of students to take online classes for a month. “We’re used to the eight inches of snow. We can handle that,” says Timonere, then and now the city manager for a town of nearly 18,000 people. “(But) when you start talking feet, and two to three inches in an hour, nobody can keep up with that.” By many measures, Lake Erie is the least spectacular of the five Great Lakes— it’s the shallowest, smallest by volume, and farthest south. But it’s creating dangerous snow conditions for millions of people from Cleveland, Ohio to Buffalo, New York and beyond. While snowfall across much of America’s upper Midwest has been below average this winter, the opposite is playing out in regions downwind of the Great Lakes. Twice so far this winter, residents along Lake Erie’s southeastern and eastern shorelines have experienced record snow storms, resulting in the national guard being mobilized and snow emergencies declared. Paradoxically, some evidence suggests our warming planet could lead to more major snow events for communities downwind of the Great Lakes. When cold air moving south from the Arctic and Canada passes over lakes that have been heated throughout the summer and fall, it creates conditions for fast water evaporation into the atmosphere that then can lead to massive, fast-falling snow dumps. (Canada's beloved outdoor ice rinks are melting away. Read more.) Because it’s shallow—just 210 feet at its deepest point—water temperatures in Lake Erie can increase rapidly during the summer and fall months. Since record keeping began in 1927, the Lake’s water temperatures have been rising. Throughout the 1950s, a thermometer submerged at Buffalo, New York, recorded temperatures at or below 69˚F for 28 days in the month of August. The past decade saw that happen on just two days, when the average temperature rose to 74˚F. Those warming waters have resulted in record low ice cover in recent winters; on the first day of 2025, Lake Erie was still ice-free, though a subsequent cool down saw much of the Lake freeze over later this winter. These warm conditions create the perfect ingredients for heavy snowfall. “On some level, compared to the past, (the lake-effect snow has been) extraordinary, this winter in particular. It’s because of how warm the lakes have been,” says Richard ‘Ricky’ Rood, professor emeritus at the University of Michigan who runs Open Climate, a website that collects and shares climate science lesson plans. “What we’re seeing this year is the fact that the Lakes are staying warm, relatively ice-free far later into the winter season, and you still have cold air outbreaks,” says Rood. A study published in the Journal of Climate in 2003 found “a statistically significant increasing trend in snowfall for the lake-effect sites” throughout the 20th century across all Great Lakes. And another study looking at Buffalo, New York and published in the journal Earth’s Future last June found that the conditions that produce lake-effect snow could produce 14 percent more precipitation as the planet warms, though some of that may fall as rain. Modeling by the Great Lakes Integrated Sciences and Assessments (GLISA) program suggests that air temperatures in the region could rise by up to 11˚F by 2100, a change that would create warmer lake water as years of warmer weather unfold. Given the complex relationship between Arctic air flows and changing climate patterns, experts say they can’t predict with certainty what future snowfall around the Great Lakes will look like, though the ingredients for severe snow storms—warming lake surface water and shots of extremely cold Arctic air—are likely to continue. “The frequency of air crossing the Great Lakes that is cold enough to produce lake-effect snow is likely decreasing on average,” says David Kristovich of the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign’s department of climate, meteorology, and atmospheric sciences. “However, it is difficult to envision a situation where occasional, extreme, relatively cold air outbreaks producing intense short-term lake-effect rains or snows stop occurring,” he adds. It’s not only Great Lakes residents who could face dangerous lake-effect snow in the years ahead. Warmer water has led to more sea- and lake-effect snow storms abroad, with trends documented in Istanbul and in cities downwind of the Sea of Japan. In January, lake-effect snow was reported along the United States Gulf Coast. Overall, winters are getting warmer, but cold air outbreaks will still occur, resulting in fewer, but more severe, storms. In January, for example, the Erie region of Pennsylvania recorded an average amount of snowfall for the month, but half of that fell in just three days. “Since the climate is actively warming, what we’re doing now is starting to sample this warming climate,” says Rood. “Do not treat these as a one-off event.” (From our September 2020 issue: The Great Lakes depend on ice. What happens when they barely freeze?) JoAnn Vranek, a retired English teacher who has lived in Ashtabula for decades, says she wasn’t able to get out of her house during the Thanksgiving weekend storm, and had to hire a snow removal contractor to clear her driveway. “I got a good deal (but) others on my street had to pay hundreds of dollars to hire people,” she says. “The house next to me, her eaves and flashing came down. She’s going to have to get that fixed. I don’t ever remember that happening before.” The local high school building where Vranek once worked and which was built less than 20 years ago at a cost of nearly $40 million, remains closed due to the snow-induced roof collapse. Authorities say it may be a year before all students are back on campus. The Thanksgiving storm also put major strain on critical services in Ashtabula. Timonere says the city’s emergency services struggled to reach people, some of whom faced high carbon monoxide readings in their homes after furnace vents were blocked by snow. One local township had to deploy a water tanker truck to put out a fire because fire hydrants were buried under the snow and fire crews couldn’t find them. “For small communities like us, we don’t have an abundance of funds to deal with this,” he says. “I don’t have 20 guys I can put on the roads when we get snow like this, like the big cities might have.” He recommends residents in the path of lake-effect snowstorms have contractors inspect their roofs. Yue Li, a professor of engineering at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, says that adapting to heavier snow storms will require serious upgrades. “Cities will need to design neighborhoods with better snow drainage systems, integrating snow storage areas (and) reviewing building standards, especially for roofs, to ensure they can withstand heavy snow loads,” he says. “Expanding access to snow removal equipment, storage sites, and backup supplies like salt and sand is vital for maintaining mobility and safety.” Ashtabula is embarking on a $100 million plan to upgrade its water treatment and wastewater infrastructure, and community leaders now find themselves taking flooding from rain and heavy snow events into account. “Hopefully this was an anomaly, but like we’ve said,” says Timonere, “the weather is changing and there’s no denying it anymore.”

TITLE: What’s behind the strange rash of ’dinosaur’ sightings in the Congo?
DATE: 
CONTENT:
For centuries, locals have told stories of mokele-mbembe, a legendary creature said to lurk in the Congo Basin. But as forests vanish, sightings are on the rise—offering a glimpse into how folklore is changing with the landscape. Trees began to quake, monkeys shrieked, and birds fled skyward. Deep in the heart of Odzala-Kokoua National Park, Selah Abong’o froze, convinced she was about to encounter something out of legend: a mokele-mbembe, Congo’s mythical dinosaur. In 2003, the young Congolese conservationist ventured into the dense forest to investigate a devastating Ebola outbreak that had wiped out over 5,000 western lowland gorillas. But that day, the epidemic took a backseat to her racing imagination. “It was just a really big forest elephant,” she laughed. “We don’t have dinosaurs here, although it’s easy to mistake an elephant or hippopotamus for one, which I did. I was a rookie back then.” Two decades later, the legend of mokele-mbembe remains alive, whispered in villages and embellished with each new “sighting,” and Abong’o says deforestation is the reason why. The Congo Basin—Earth’s second-largest rainforest and one of its most vital ecosystems—has lost 23 million hectares of forest since Abong’o’s so-called dinosaur encounter, an area comparable to the entire United Kingdom. As human settlements creep further into habitats, encounters between locals and wildlife are becoming more frequent. Mokele-mbembe has shifted from a Western, pseudo-scientific obsession among cryptozoologists and creationist ministers back to its roots as a local African legend shared by those who have long known its story. “In bigger settlements where habitats are being pushed into and people aren’t used to seeing large animals, they’re suddenly encountering them all the time,” says Laura Vlachova, a Czech conservationist. “It’s these people who tell me they’ve seen mokele-mbembe. I think what it really shows is how folklore is starting to reflect the reality of a shrinking ecosystem.” Among the Ba’Aka—a forest-dwelling people indigenous to the Central African Republic, Republic of Congo, Gabon, and Cameroon—stories of the “one who stops rivers” have endured for centuries, says Abong’o. If the legendary creature does exist, it would likely reside in Lake Tele, a remote body of water cocooned by virgin jungle in the Likouala swamps. The lake lies within the Lac Télé Community Reserve, a pristine, 4,400-square-kilometer expanse where surveys in 2006 and 2007 uncovered an astonishing 125,000 gorillas—more than the species’ total estimated global population at the time. Yet, despite its remoteness, habitat loss is escalating in the region. Settlements in the region rely heavily on slash-and-burn agriculture, clearing patches of forest to grow cassava, peanuts, bananas, and maize. Trees and shrubs are felled, and the remaining vegetation is burned to enrich the soil with ash, offering short-lived fertility. Usually, within two to five years, the soil becomes depleted again, which forces farmers to clear new land—perpetuating an ecological nightmare of a cycle. In 2023, Congolese biologist Joseph Oyange observed this firsthand when visiting a family in northern Congo. He watched the smoke rise from two hectares of the jungle they had cleared, unwittingly disrupting the gorilla habitat. The displaced primates foraged in the fields by night, leaving crops trampled by morning. One teenager, hearing gorilla cries, later told Oyange, “It was mokele-mbembe roaring.” “There’s often a certain degree of truth to these myths, so I don’t completely disregard them,” says Allard Blom, vice president of global programs of African forests for the World Wildlife Fund (WWF). “But I am skeptical, and until someone shows me proof of a dinosaur-like animal, I don’t believe it. There’s usually a real animal it’s being mistaken for.” The Congo Basin isn’t just a source of folklore, however. It’s a crucial ecosystem for both local communities and the planet. Spanning an area second only to the Amazon, it is often called the “lungs of Africa.” It absorbs 1.5 billion tons of CO2 annually, ranking it the world’s largest carbon sink. But it’s under siege. Agriculture, logging, mining, and a swelling population carve more into the jungle each year, while government corruption greenlights unchecked encroachment. The relentless appetite for bushmeat, the march of industry, and the looming shadow of climate change all have a hand in destroying the Congo. Weakening the rainforest, of course, will have global implications. One of those is the growing proximity between humans and wildlife, which facilitates the transmission of zoonotic diseases—illnesses that jump from animals to humans, such as COVID-19, Ebola, and monkeypox. “The more we’re exposed to wild animals, the higher the chances these viruses will make the jump into the human population,” says Blom. “It’s a simple question of statistics.” But this dynamic is a double-edged sword. The “rapid increase in the Congo Basin, driven by commerce,” exposes endangered gorillas and chimpanzees to disease—an impact his team sees clearly as both populations continue to decline year after year, says Gwili Gibbon, conservation manager at African Parks. The ripple effects of these interactions aren’t new to Selah Abong’o, who mistook a forest elephant for a mokele-mbembe nearly 20 years prior. “My colleagues still tease me about that,” she says with a smirk. “But when I think about it now, it saddens me. People are still confusing elephants and apes for mokele-mbembe, and that’s largely because of deforestation. Zoonotic diseases, like Ebola, are still spreading as people encroach more on the forest. And the Congo,” she paused, “is still disappearing.”

TITLE: The world's largest iceberg is on a collision course with vital penguin sanctuary
DATE: 
CONTENT:
This megaberg is the size of Rhode Island and weighs a trillion tons. It could ground to a halt near South Georgia, a critical wildlife haven. An enormous iceberg known as A23a is heading towards South Georgia: a remote island in the southern Atlantic Ocean, filled with seals and penguins. The trillion-ton megaberg was stuck in the ocean for nearly 40 years but, now it’s on the move. Although it’s creeping along at under 1.5 miles per hour per hour, some experts are worried about its potential impact on this wildlife haven. How did the iceberg break free, how might it affect penguin and seal populations, and is this related to climate change? Here’s everything you need to know. In 1986, A23a—icebergs are named sequentially based on the Antarctic quadrant in which they were first seen—calved from the Filchner Ice Shelf. Iceberg calving is the natural process of icebergs breaking off from the ice shelf, which happens all the time. A23a is notable for its size: “several tens of kilometers in length and a few hundred meters in depth,” says Martin Siegert, a polar scientist at the University of Exeter. “It's not uncommon, it's not unnatural, but it is unusual because it's just so big; very, very big.” At just over 1,400 square miles, A23a could currently fill all of New York City, Los Angeles, and Houston combined. Because of its epic proportions, the behemoth “almost immediately got stuck” on the seabed around the continental shelf, which was too shallow for its keel to pass over, he says. “It kept sitting there until about 2020” says Andrew Meijers, science leader of the British Antarctic Survey’s polar oceans program. As it lingered, the iceberg gradually melted and was buffeted by winds and ocean currents as chunks of ice tumbled into the water. Eventually, it freed itself into the deep ocean. In April 2024, it became stuck again, circling in a Taylor Column— “an oceanographic phenomenon where rotating water above a seamount traps objects in place,” according to the British Antarctic Survey. After breaking free in December, it’s now traveling along the Antarctic circumpolar current. “It's the strongest current on Earth,” says Meijers. “It's going to head more or less straight towards [South Georgia],” says Meijers. This wildlife haven is home to fur seals, albatrosses, gentoo penguins, and more. On its current trajectory, A23a will reach a sharp turn in the current. “The iceberg weighs a trillion tons so it's not turning on a dime,” he says. If it overshoots, it could run aground in shallow waters until it melts enough to keep moving or break up. “It’s anyone’s guess what it might do,” he says. Grounding near the shallow continental shelf close to South Georgia could block off routes between feeding and breeding areas for many penguin and seal colonies. This disruption “forces the adults to swim further, burn more energy and, basically, bring back less,” says Meijers, resulting in higher mortality and potentially worsening the impact of bird flu on both seals and penguins Timing is important. “In October, the penguins decide where they're going to nest,” says Maria Vernet, a marine ecologist at Scripps Institution of Oceanography, UC San Diego. An enormous, steep iceberg that’s “more like an apartment building,” is a bigger threat when the eggs and chicks are in the nest and utterly dependent on their parents. “But by February, all those chicks should be out of their nest” and can forage for themselves, she says. There are other potential impacts. In 2000, the B15 iceberg calved off the Ross Ice Shelf and acted “like a shield,” says Vernet, reducing the amount of light that could penetrate the ocean and reduced the growth of phytoplankton—which forms the base of the food web. On the flip side, as the iceberg melts, it deposits iron that it picked up from grinding along the seabed, and stirs up deep waters, bringing rich nutrients to the surface. This encourages plankton blooms, “which attract krill, which then support pretty much everything in the Southern Ocean,” says Meijers. “Drifting icebergs generate a little ecosystem with them,” says Vernet. If it brings the krill close to the rookeries, the penguins would have a feast. “The ocean current is a series of complex, interconnected eddies,” says Siegert. “The average flow is in a certain direction, but it’s really complicated,” making it nearly impossible to predict where icebergs will drift. Several icebergs have followed a similar path: in 2004, A38 grounded on South Georgia’s continental shelf with catastrophic wildlife impacts, A68 melted and missed South Georgia in 2020–2021, and, in 2023, A76 broke into smaller pieces in the waters around the island. If A23a breaks up, it could be dangerous for ships navigating the treacherous Southern Ocean. “It’s the stormiest, most unpleasant ocean in the world,” says Siegert. It’s easy to track a slab of ice twice the size of London, but following a series of smaller icebergs is much harder. Plus, these can suddenly overturn. This iceberg is “not something that is necessarily human-made, a climate problem—it’s not that,” says Siegert. “There's loads of icebergs calving all the time.” But it helps to shine a spotlight on climate issues the region is struggling with. “Antarctica is experiencing mass loss to global warming and burning fossil fuels,” he says. Ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctic are losing ice six times more quickly than they were 30 years ago. “There’s been an acceleration in the loss of the number of icebergs,” says Meijers. “Big ‘berg calvings are important, but a lot of it happens in much smaller chunks.” It doesn’t take much to change these vulnerable ecosystems, and Siegert is concerned about the consequences of Antarctica’s ice loss. “This is a fragile environment,” he says. Melting Antarctic ice sheets have a global ripple effect. The Southern Ocean helps to regulate the world’s climate by absorbing both heat and carbon, but warming waters make this harder. The melting also causes sea level rise. “There’s two meters of sea level rise locked in,” says Meijers. “There's nothing we can really do about that.” For South Georgia, one thing’s certain. “It’s definitely going to shake things up,” says Vernet, “but it’s too early to tell whether it will be positive or negative for the ecosystem.” Says Siegert: “from quite a cold, objective scientific perspective, it's actually quite an interesting phenomenon.”

TITLE: Wildfires are making their way east—where they could be much deadlier
DATE: 
CONTENT:
We all know wildfires have been getting worse in the drought-stricken western U.S., but experts say the growing risk on the east coast is concerning. When we think of wildfires, we often think of western states like California where massive blazes, such as the fires that burned in and around Los Angeles earlier this year. But more than 100 fires recently burned through North and South Carolina amid dry and windy conditions. While California and other western states face a high wildfire risk, the west is less densely populated and fires often arise in the wilderness. Not so in the eastern and southern United States, where population density puts more people and property at risk. According to the U.S. Census, 56 percent of the U.S. population lives in the eastern and southern regions of the country, compared to just 24 percent in the West. New research shows that there may be cause for concern in the East as well, where fire size, numbers, and total area burned seem to be increasing. Published in Geophysical Research Letters last year, researchers used data collected over a 36-year period to show that large wildfire numbers doubled from 2005-2018, compared to the two decades prior. The biggest increases were seen in the Southern Coastal Plains of Florida, portions of coastal Georgia, and South Carolina where the five largest wildfires occurred. Significant wildfires were also common in the Central Appalachian Mountains of Tennessee, West Virginia, and Virginia. Conversely, wildfire numbers decreased in the northeastern U.S. as shifting climactic conditions led to more precipitation. The goal of the study was to identify whether wildfires were growing in frequency and scope, not to show what was causing this increase. But the authors speculate that warmer, drier conditions brought on by a changing climate combined with a lack of prescribed fires has led to a proliferation of woodier plants, trees, and shrubs that provide the fuel for fires to burn in greater strength and numbers. “This makes for wildfire conditions that are much more difficult for us to suppress,” says Victoria Donovan, lead author of the study and an ecologist at the University of Florida’s West Florida Research and Education Center in Milton, Florida. Invasive species like Cogongrass, a perennial weed capable of driving wildfires deeper into the forest, have also taken over large swaths of the South, across Alabama, Mississippi, and Florida. The grass increases the instances of wildfires because, once ignited, it burns hotter and faster and regrows more rapidly than native grasses. While the fires aren’t as large as they are in the West, the risk to humans is much greater. “In the East we have a greater wildlife-urban interface, where we’ve seen more people intermingling with wild land vegetation,” says Donovan. The study points to examples like the 2016 Gatlinburg fire in Tennessee, which, although less than a tenth of the size of the Camp Fire, destroyed nearly 2,500 structures and killed 14 people. When wildfires ignite in densely populated areas, they not only increase the risk of a loss of life, but also become harder to defend. Additionally, the danger of wildfire smoke extends much farther than just the immediate area of the fire and can impact more people in the eastern U.S. Last year’s Canadian wildfires, for example, placed more than a third of the U.S. population under air quality advisories. The study also found that 85 percent of wildfires were caused by humans, a statistic which isn’t surprising to Volker Radeloff, a forestry professor at the University of Wisconsin Madison who was not involved in the study. He says that when fires happen in populated areas, the risk of human ignition increases. People can start fires for any number of reasons, and in populated areas it puts the landscape at risk. They might be burning dead leaves in their backyard, and it gets out of hand—or, in the case of the Gatlinburg fire, two teenage boys playing with matches set the land ablaze. “In these areas where houses and wildlife vegetation intermingle it’s kind of a double whammy because when a fire occurs lots of houses are at risk, you have to evacuate people, and there’s also more people to start fires either intentionally or unintentionally,” says Radeloff. While the study did show that the number of wildfires in the past four decades have increased, it’s challenging to point to trends because in the East, there’s still so much variability in the weather from year to year, says Loretta Mickley, a senior climate research fellow at Harvard, who was not involved in the study. “There will be one huge fire one year and then not much in the years to follow. You’re left wondering whether it’s a bad year or a trend,” she says. Similarly, it's unclear whether wildfires burning in North and South Carolina are part of a possible trend. While in the West you can see a clear upward trend in fires as precipitation decreases and temperatures increase, in the East the weather is less predictable. In an El Niño year, for example, the distribution of rainfall in the South and East may quell the risk of wildfires. She says that the study is an “important first step” in showing us where we need to be taking care to protect the landscape. And no matter whether it’s a trend or not, the numbers are concerning. “Right now, it’s safe to say that in the Eastern U.S. there are quite a few eco-regions that have had more fires in the last five to 10 years than in the decades before that,” says Radeloff.

TITLE: Marine engineers: Five species that shape underwater ecosystems
DATE: 
CONTENT:
Among the myriad creatures that populate our ocean, some stand out as having an outsized impact on the marine environment—shaping and maintaining habitats that themselves sustain countless other forms of life. Ecosystem engineers are species whose behaviors help build, modify and maintain an array of underwater worlds. None of these creatures are impacting our ocean like human beings, however. Which is why Prada Group, together with UNESCO-IOC, created the SEA BEYOND educational program—which benefits from 1 percent of the proceeds from the Prada Re-Nylon for SEA BEYOND Collection—that teaches ocean literacy in schools around the world. The hope is to inspire a new generation of ocean custodians to discover creatures like the ones described below. And in understanding them, feel an urgent need to protect them. Coral polyps are among the greatest builders on our planet. From the tropics to the Arctic, these tiny creatures spend thousands of years patiently constructing the largest living structures on Earth. Corals are actually microscopic animals that enjoy a symbiotic relationship with tiny algae called zooxanthellae. The corals provide the zooxanthellae with the carbon dioxide and water they need to photosynthesize, while the zooxanthellae supply the building blocks of sugars and proteins the corals need in order to secrete the calcium carbonate that forms the building materials of the vast three dimensional ‘cities’ that account for approximately 1 percent of the ocean floor, yet support approximately 25 percent of all marine species. Coral reefs provide more than just shelter though—they modify the flow of water and influence wave patterns, distributing nutrients and larvae, especially in the tropics. They also provide coastal barriers that protect coasts from storm surges and erosion. Find a human architect or engineer who can do all of that! Unlike most sharks, whale sharks are filter feeders, a trait they share with that other ocean behemoth, the whale. These gentle giants cycle vast amounts of nutrients through their feeding habits and as such play a crucial role in regulating marine microbes like plankton, as well as chemicals like nitrogen that support all life in the ocean. Whale sharks spend most of their lives migrating vast distances between feeding grounds and in doing so they deposit vital nutrients through their excrement, which in turn fertilizes phytoplankton blooms, helping to regulate the spread of these crucial microorganisms across different biogeographical zones, as well as through the water column. Research shows that whale sharks routinely dive to depths below 3,200 feet (1,000 meters), vertically blending nutrients by feeding on krill in deep waters, before excreting them closer to the surface. This fertilizing activity, which is shared by many cetaceans, is known as the “whale pump,” or in some circles “the poop loop,” and supports the entire web of life in the ocean. Whale sharks also help regulate fish populations by preventing any single species from dominating the ecosystem. Deep sea mussels are not like the mussels you might enjoy in a white wine, butter, and lemon juice sauce. Unlike their shallow water counterparts, deep sea mussels live and die in the lightless depths of the ocean, between 1,600 feet (500 meters) and close to 10,000 feet (3,000 meters) underwater. Their preferred habitat is in close proximity to hydrothermal vents that spew water laden with chemicals that are toxic to human beings, but provide the mussels with the compounds they need to create energy. Over time, they gather in dense colonies that can cover thousands of square feet of the sea bed, forming complex three-dimensional habitats, not unlike reefs, that provide shelter for a wide variety of deep sea species. The deep-sea bivalves act like a vast filtration system, modifying the chemical composition of the water around the vents so that it is more habitable. Like corals, they are symbiotes, hosting tiny bacteria that assist them with metabolic conversions, as well as protecting them from viruses and other harmful bacteria. They may lack the charisma of corals, but blow lugworms (Arenicola marina) play a crucial role in shaping both underwater and terrestrial topographies. They are not unlike earthworms, except instead of soil, they process sediment through a combination of burrowing and feeding that is known as bioturbation. These activities form funnels in the sand that facilitate the transfer of oxygen and help prevent sand from clogging. At the same time, the lugworms literally “eat” the sand, extracting tiny microorganisms and organic matter as they ingest it. They then pop their tails just above the surface and excrete the processed sand, creating the distinctive tiny coils that can be seen across beaches all over the world. Yes, these coils are lugworm poops. At the same time, lugworm burrows provide habitats for other species, while the entire intertidal ecosystem is made more habitable thanks to their filtering activities. If you’ve ever dived or snorkeled a coral reef, chances are you will have encountered these champions of marine industry. And if you’ve ever set foot on a tropical beach, then you’ve witnessed the outcome of their hard work. Parrotfish—so named for their colorful livery and powerful beaks—are literally able to create beaches. They do so by feeding on the algae that grow inside coral polyps, inadvertently ingesting huge amounts of calcium carbonate in the process. Their digestive systems then convert the coral skeleton into fine white sand. They are voracious eaters and can take 20 bites of coral in a minute—making them prolific excreters, too. It’s estimated that a single parrotfish can generate nearly 2,000 pounds (900 kilograms) of sand in a year. Scientists believe they play a key role in shaping coastal ecosystems around coral reefs, even helping to form coral atolls. Through SEA BEYOND, Prada Group and UNESCO-IOC have reached almost 35,000 students from 184 schools and 56 countries around the world, investigating the connection between the ocean and climate and related environmental challenges. Find out more about how understanding our ocean can be the very thing to help save it; and more about Prada Group’s work with UNESCO-IOC here.

TITLE: What drew these 1,300 perfect circles on the sea floor? We may finally know.
DATE: 
CONTENT:
When hundreds of eerily perfect circles were discovered on the bottom of the Mediterranean Sea, theories abounded about what they could mean. Four years of underwater research revealed a lost world. On a bright, hot day in mid-September 2011, Marine biologist named Christine Pergent-Martini was hunkered down inside the cabin of a small research vessel, a 97-foot-long catamaran, cruising through the Mediterranean Sea about 12 miles off the coast of Corsica. Outside the ship’s windows, the sun glinted off the dark-blue water, but Pergent-Martini ignored the waves. She was more interested in what lay beneath them. A monitor in front of her displayed images from the vessel’s onboard sonar system, which was emitting a series of short acoustic pulses to reveal the underwater topography about 400 feet below. The ocean scientist was nearing the last day of a month-long mission: With a small crew, including her husband, oceanographer Gérard Pergent, and a graduate student from the University of Corsica Pasquale Paoli, Pergent-Martini had been mapping the seafloor in this region. The seemingly simple goal actually targeted one of oceanography’s major blind spots. The Mediterranean Sea covers about a million square miles, stretching from the Strait of Gibraltar in the west to Lebanon in the east. While its surface has been traversed since ancient times by everything from Greek triremes to Etruscan warships, its depths are mysterious to modern science. Much of its seafloor exists in something of a liminal zone: too shallow and close to the shore to draw interest from deep-sea mining companies but still too deep to be reachable by conventional scuba divers. Pergent-Martini and her colleagues wanted to learn more about what lived on the bottom at these depths. At first, the day was no different from any other. As the boat moved across the water, the scientists watched a series of predictable grainy black-and-white images appear on-screen: Sand. Small rocks. More sand. It was all stuff they’d seen before. But then something truly bizarre scrolled into view. A perfect circle, then another, then another. They were all about the same size—around 67 feet in diameter—with a distinct outline and striking symmetry. Weirder still, almost every ring had a dark spot directly in the center. They looked like fried eggs, Pergent-Martini thought, and there appeared to be several dozen of them. The scientists looked at each other. “We had no idea what it was,” Pergent-Martini says. Her team carefully logged their location and used a remotely operated vehicle to gather images. Still, the mystery only deepened. They captured video footage of the circles, but the view was too murky to confirm much more than the fact that this wasn’t sunken cargo. When the researchers presented their findings at a 2013 scientific meeting, they were still in search of answers about the nature of the rings. Even a follow-up study with a submarine in 2014 didn’t answer all their questions. In time, researchers would count more than 1,300 of these circles over a nearly six-square-mile area. After years of applying for grants to study the rings more closely, the Pergents reached a dead end. “It was very difficult to obtain money,” Pergent-Martini said. The Pergents are specialists in seagrass meadows, and this was a bit outside their focus. “We had no way to go farther.” Then, just the right person got in touch. In the world of undersea exploration, Laurent Ballesta is known for going to extremes. A photographer, marine biologist, technical diver, and National Geographic Explorer, he co-runs Andromède Océanologie, a company that leads scientific missions to document some of the world’s most inaccessible places. These undertakings often require specialized equipment and elaborate dive plans. In Antarctica, for instance, he once used a bespoke system of cables to photograph the underside of an iceberg. In South Africa he has explored deep underwater caves to capture images of rare coelacanths, which were thought to be extinct for millions of years before small, fragile populations were rediscovered. And in French Polynesia he’s used a customized rebreather system to stay underwater for 24 hours at a time to observe the hunting habits of gray reef sharks, as chronicled in a 2018 story for National Geographic. Ballesta and his team are always on the hunt for their next target. He also had a connection to the Pergents—he’d studied under them while working toward his master’s degree. So when he read his former teachers’ scientific paper about the mysterious pockmarked sonar scans, he was riveted. Some organisms have been known to grow in circular formations—corals make atolls, for example. But these rings repeated with an eerie regularity. (Scientists discover world’s largest coral—so big it can be seen from space.) “How is this possible?” he remembers thinking. Perhaps they were craters caused by erupting underwater vents or a strange geological formation. Pergent-Martini and her husband had a different hunch. Based on their submersible explorations, they believed the rings were coralline algae growing in a previously unknown shape. Another theory, put forth by some scientists, was that they were craters left by unused World War II bombs jettisoned by U.S. planes returning to their bases on Corsica. With the Pergents’ approval, Ballesta decided to pick up where they’d left off in hopes of solving the mystery, using their data to locate the rings. In July 2020, Ballesta and two other divers from Andromède Océanologie arrived above the rings in their own research vessel and donned scuba gear to descend into the abyss. While they quickly sank to the bottom, they stayed there only about 30 minutes because they had to account for at least several hours of decompression time on the way back to the surface. Equipped with a waterproof camera and lights, the team swam down through the bright upper waters of the ocean, the daylight gradually dimming to twilight. In less than two minutes they were approaching their destination, nearly 400 feet below the waves. “I stopped before I reached the bottom, some 20 or 30 meters up,” says Ballesta, “because I saw the rings.” They loomed out of the darkness, alien, enormous; they resembled gigantic platters etched onto the seafloor. After he snapped some photos, Ballesta dived to the bottom and approached one ring. At its center was a large knob made by red calcareous algae, measuring around three feet high and several feet across, with swaying fanlike growths atop it. The knob was surrounded by a vast wasteland of pale, scree-like debris. And slightly downhill, about 30 feet beyond the center, was the dark outer ring, a circular perimeter that appeared to be made up of rhodoliths, a collection of craggy, firm, pebble-size algae. Looking at the structure, Ballesta realized that the Pergents were right. “It was alive,” he says. (Sea creatures pollinate marine plants and algae, surprising scientists.) After 27 minutes on the bottom, Ballesta and his crew spent nearly five hours gradually rising to decompress safely, allowing their bodies to equalize to the shifting pressure. Long before he got back to the boat, Ballesta was convinced he had to return. “I didn’t need 27 minutes,” he says about his time on the seafloor. “After the first minute, I knew.” Julie Deter, a marine ecologist who was waiting for the team back on the ship deck, saw the excitement on their faces the moment they surfaced. Usually, by the time divers complete their long monotonous ascent, the thrill has faded. “But they were still very marked by what they had seen,” she says. There was still no explanation for why the rhodoliths would have formed such perfect circles so many times over. Ballesta decided he needed to spend more time among the rings, which would require a way to stay longer in the depths. In july 2021, Ballesta returned to the waters north of Corsica with three divers—Roberto Rinaldi, Thibault Rauby, and Antonin Guilbert—and a bold plan that would give them more time for exploration on the seafloor. They were inspired by divers on oil rigs who can quickly travel back and forth to the ocean bottom. At the surface, those rig divers live in sealed, pressurized chambers that match the conditions beneath the sea, where the pressure can increase by 10 or more times. They can then rapidly ascend and descend in a diving bell without having to slowly adjust to the change in pressure. (How billions of dollars and cutting-edge tech are revolutionizing ocean exploration.) Inside their own chamber at the surface, Ballesta and the others would live a bit like astronauts. Food would be passed in through an airlock. When they were ready to descend, they’d suit up and squeeze into the diving bell that would take them down to the seabed. The team had expected to spend three weeks exploring the rings and nearby reefs, but the weather turned against them. Heavy wind and waves rocked the boat, making leaving the chamber dangerous on several occasions. For multiple days, the four men were trapped, unable to see out of their increasingly humid chamber, which barely held their small beds and a dining table. Ballesta’s voice turns bitter as he recalls this period. Time for exploration was precious, and they were spending it reading novels. Finally the weather shifted, offering them the chance to drop down through the elevator chamber. “We found ourselves in another universe,” says Guilbert. This time, the crew could spend hours exploring it. All around, the divers marveled at the abundance of life. As they made more dives, when weather conditions allowed, they found rarely seen yellow corals in the deep canyons. There were also squat lobsters and colorful small fish hiding among pale pink gorgonians, the sort of fanlike soft corals that are usually seen in deep Mediterranean canyons. At one point Ballesta spotted a blue sea slug wandering about and took a photo. It was the first still photograph taken of this species by a diver. (These images will help you see coral reefs in a whole new way.) Ballesta invited the Pergents to monitor their progress aboard the support ship. “They looked very happy and touched that their discovery made this project happen,” he says. Because of the Pergents’ work, he and his colleagues were exploring a pristine and unusual ecosystem. But Ballesta knew this little universe was in a precarious position: It existed under shipping lanes, and commercial ships dropping anchor could pulverize everything. “Anchors can destroy all the rings very easily,” Ballesta says. The threat fueled a sense of urgency: The more they could learn about the rings, the better chance Ballesta might have of getting French authorities to protect them. Ballesta and his team made a total of six descents from their pressurized chamber to the rings. They focused their attention on drilling cores of the rings’ central knobs, which were then sent for carbon dating analysis. The hope was that knowing the rings’ age could help solve the mystery of what formed them and how. When the results came back, the team was shocked. The most ancient material, deep in the center of the knobs, was about 21,000 years old. For those who study climate history, that particular era represents a moment of profound planetary change. “It’s the last glacial maximum,” says paleoclimatologist Edouard Bard of the Collège de France, who organized the carbon dating. That was the peak of the last ice age. Back then, the Mediterranean was colder and far shallower, and the place where the rings are today would have been less than 65 feet from the surface, bathed in sunlight. In the summer of 2023, Ballesta returned to the rings, this time with a support vessel capable of launching two submarines to allow ocean and climate experts, including Bard, to make their own extended voyages into the ecosystem. The effort, which received funding from the National Geographic Society, was intended to form a scientifically rigorous hypothesis of exactly how the circles emerged. On one dive, Ballesta swam alongside the submersible as it scooted above the seabed. Acting as a tour guide, he showed the scientists inside various aspects of the rings and their surroundings. There were underwater caves nearby, set into a small cliff. The divers had found several caverns with layers of sediment that confirmed the area had once been situated above the ancient coastline—the voids may have been first cut through erosion as water washed against the cliffs some 21,000 years ago. Near the end of the trip, the scientists retreated to the ship’s cabin. Hooked up to the glitchy internet, Bard and the others were reading papers, looking at maps, thinking over what they’d seen. Slowly, over the next few months, they put together a hypothesis. Even though, to a nonexpert, the knobs in the center of the rings might look like coral, they were not. They were deposits formed by coralline algae, photosynthetic organisms that create skeletons made of calcium carbonate. During the last ice age, thousands of these algae colonies likely took root on what was then a very sunny seafloor. For 3,000 years or so, these algae flourished, growing outward like domes or pancakes measuring several yards. Then, around 20,000 years ago, the world began to warm and continental ice sheets began to melt, funneling into the Mediterranean, which rose until the sun-loving algae were drowned in darkness. Their domes collapsed, leaving only the central knobs and bits of calcium carbonate scattered like bones from a carcass around them. For thousands of years, nothing lived amid the remains that left a permanent imprint. But about 8,000 years ago, the sea level stabilized. Deepwater algae laid down new layers on the central knobs, creating the film of life the divers saw. At the same time, rhodolith algae started to encase broken bits of calcium. The nuggets of algae rolled downhill from the knobs, settling around the base of the cones in perfect circles. That’s everyone’s best guess: The simple tug of gravity formed the rings. (We finally know what caused Florida fish to spin in circles until they died.) “We don’t have all the proof,” admits Ballesta. “But we have nothing to say our history is wrong.” Protecting the entire field of rings may prove difficult. Only about one-third of them lie within the Cap Corse and Agriate Marine Natural Park, a French marine protected area. But the park, with help from Ballesta’s Andromède Océanologie, is taking on this challenge. Using data from Ballesta’s dives, it plans to advocate for the further protection of all rings, even those located outside its bounds, in French and Italian waters. The park’s management council will propose prohibiting the anchoring of commercial vessels in the area. “Normally with this type of regulation, it takes years,” Ballesta says. But because so many of the rings already exist within a conservation zone, he’s optimistic. He’s also no longer thinking just about the rings but about what they represent. Traces like these—signs of the ancient coastline, including rings, submerged caves, and other mysterious structures—may be hidden all around the ocean floor. They are places for studying how the world is always building something new on the husk of a previous age. While there have been no sightings of the rings elsewhere, “you have to realize that explorations at this depth have been rare in the Mediterranean Sea,” Pergent-Martini says. “Perhaps there are others that have not yet been discovered.”

TITLE: Are these the last days of Brazil's realm of hidden wonder?
DATE: 
CONTENT:
The largest agricultural boom on the planet threatens to destroy a spectacular savanna. Here's what happens when progress outpaces preservation. It’s called the Cerrado, Portuguese for ‘closed,’ and for nearly all of human historythis vast tropical savanna in central Brazil seems to have been shut off from the rest of the world. People do live there; hunter-gatherer groups, overcoming the formidable wilds, have roamed the Cerrado since the Stone Age. And in colonial times, those escaping slavery often disappeared behind the hills, where they built tight-knit communities, unlocked the land’s subtle gifts, and settled in. Otherwise, across centuries, hardly anyone ventured inside. The terrain was repellent to visitors, practically impossible to traverse. Much of the Cerrado is a dense, tangled mess of stunted trees and shrubs, the whole place crawling with snakes. It pales in lushness to the mighty Amazon rainforest to the north, the green lungs of the Earth. Even some scientists who study the Cerrado call it ugly; the common term for its scrubland is —“dirty field.” But the main reason the Cerrado was ignored beyond Indigenous peoples and those seeking refuge is that no one could find money in it—no hardwoods, no diamonds, no oil. The soil is highly acidic, deadly to most non-native plants, and during the six-month dry season the land is often ravaged by fire. Until the mid-20th century, the Cerrado was dismissed by the capitalist world as a wasteland. Best to leave it closed and move on. (The paradise in Brazil you don’t know—yet.) In the 1950s, Brazil found a use for it. The nation, leaping into the global economy, decided to construct a new capital city, a monument to Brazilian progress, in the center of the country. So a hunk of the Cerrado, smack in the middle, was cleared, and Brasília rose up. Five million people now live there; only São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, and Belo Horizonte are bigger. Then, in the 1970s, came a more sweeping transformation. Brazilian agricultural scientists working in a government lab cooked up a fertilizer, packed with lime, that modified the harsh Cerrado soil and enabled cash crops to grow. Industrial watering systems could counteract the dry season, and fire brigades would snuff out the flames. The Cerrado was open for business. Bulldozers and tractors rolled in, and thousands of square miles of scrubby Cerrado were scraped clean. Corn, sugarcane, and especially soybeans were planted, then trucked across the country to seaports. China, the United States, and Europe bought them up, and the land clearing intensified. The largest agricultural corporations in the world established massive factory farms there. The Brazilian economy roared. More land was churned up; there seemed no limit: The Cerrado’s size is Texas times three. The area, according to a 2021 report from the World Bank, has “the greatest agricultural potential on the planet.”  Along with government workers and farmhands, a new generation of biologists, many lured by the science department at the University of Brasília, also came to the Cerrado, curious about this relatively unknown region, always considered less worthy of study than the Amazon. Over the past two decades, scientific attention has focused on the area even as it has shifted toward becoming an ecological “sacrifice zone”—what land-use experts call a place, lacking strong environmental protection, that caters to human consumption. And the Cerrado’s great secrets have emerged. Turning away most humans for millennia appears to have been an ideal strategy for preserving extraordinary biodiversity. The Cerrado, researchers from the University of Brasília and elsewhere have tallied, is home to more than 11,000 species of plants and trees, 40 percent of which exist nowhere else. There are 800 bird species, 1,200 fish species, and 90,000 insect species. The golden-furred, stilt-legged maned wolf prowls the Cerrado, as does the giant anteater, which grows up to seven feet long, not including its two-foot tongue. There are wide populations of bees, snakes, lizards, bats, and butterflies. About 5 percent of Earth’s animal and plant species are thought to live in the Cerrado, the biologically richest savanna in the world. (Discover all 25 of the best places to visit in 2025, including the Cerrado.) The real secret, though, is what you can’t observe. The soil in the Cerrado runs deep, in places 80 feet, and to help survive the dry season and its fires, many plants sprout extensive root systems. The vast majority of the Cerrado’s biomass is subterranean. Some trees that look like spindly fence posts aboveground are muscle-rooted and brawny below. Biologists who examine this hidden realm call the Cerrado the upside-down forest. This underground world performs priceless ecological services. It’s a massive carbon sink, locking away billions of tons of carbon dioxide in well-buried roots. As the Cerrado is converted to farmland—the current rate is more than 4,000 acres a day—the greenhouse gas is released. Each year, according to the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), the discharge due to altering the Cerrado is equivalent to the annual emissions of 50 million cars. If all the carbon held by the Cerrado were discharged, this might single-handedly push global warming over the 1.5-degree Celsius limit set by the United Nations at the Paris climate conference of 2015, a point at which the global ice sheets could inexorably melt, causing the seas to inundate every coastal city. Deep soil is also a sponge. The Cerrado collects and stores seasonal rains in immense subterranean chambers. The more land that’s cut above, the less water held below. These aquifers, geologists report, feed the headwaters of eight of the 12 major river basins in South America. The Cerrado’s underground tanks pump water all over the continent. If the Amazon is the lungs, the Cerrado is the heart. (Another weapon to fight climate change? Put carbon back where we found it.) To get to a place where the Cerrado’s pulse can be experienced untamed and raw, take the road north out of Brasília. It first runs arrow straight through the suburbs, then direct to the factory farms. Rows of soybeans roll to the horizons; grain trucks outnumber cars. Tractors spray the fields with white mist. More than 150 million gallons of pesticides, Brazilian environmental journalists report, douse the Cerrado each year. “The land has been decimated,” says Brazilian ecologist Paulo Oliveira, editor of The Cerrados of Brazil, a book that explores the natural history of the region. And soybeans, for the most part, aren’t eaten by people—they’re shipped around the globe to feed cattle. The world demands beef. After a couple of hours of driving, the windshield spattered with bugs, hills rise up, the giant farms dissipate, and the Cerrado exists in a natural state. The terrain, admittedly, can appear weird. Soil toxicity meddles with tree growth, making the trunks all gnarled and hunched. The frequent fires scorch the buds at the ends of branches, which are replaced by lower buds that grow at contorted angles, then those eventually get fire-burned too, and so on. It’s basically a big thicket of elbows. Though not every Cerrado landscape looks Dr. Seuss strange. The Cerrado is one huge, interconnected biome composed of a dozen varieties of smaller ecosystems, ranging from open grassland to dense, full-size woods. Driving deeper in, some 150 miles from Brasília, travelers approach Chapada dos Veadeiros, one of the national parks in the Cerrado, where sections of closed-canopy forest shroud tumbling rivers. There’s a tourist town here, Alto Paraíso—High Paradise—where a steady stream of visitors, primarily from other parts of Brazil, hire certified hiking guides, lounge in streams, and purchase genuine Cerrado crystals, from pendant-necklace size to paperweight, dug from the ancient soil and perfect, say the shopkeepers, for cleansing your aura. (Learn more about tapirs.) (Volunteers coming to rescue animals injured during Brazil's wildfires.) This is where the battle for the Cerrado is being waged, between those who cherish the otherworldly place as it is and those bending the land to their will. Less than 10 percent of the Cerrado falls under any environmental protection, mostly state parks and mixed-use areas where people live and grow crops. Only 3 percent is under full federal preservation. The national parks are just specks in the vastness. By comparison, about half of the Amazon biome is protected—and the Amazon is specifically named in the Brazilian Constitution as a national heritage zone, but not the Cerrado. An estimated four-fifths of the entire Cerrado has already been disturbed by human activities, almost everything happening in the past 50 years. No one knows how many unique species of plants or animals have already been lost. (Explore the mystery and wonder of the Amazon in this interactive special issue.) International conservation organizations like WWF and Global Witness, as well as Brazilian groups such as the National Campaign in Defense of the Cerrado, have mobilized. They seek to spread awareness of the Cerrado and its precarious situation and implore the Brazilian government to safeguard what’s left. A team of Brazilian forestry scientists, in a notable 2017 paper, demonstrated that the Cerrado’s essential ground layers, which contain most of the endemic species, are painfully slow at self-repair; a section of cleared land that had been abandoned for more than 20 years hardly seemed to regenerate much biodiversity. At times, Brazilian legislators seem receptive to the idea that consumption and conservation can exist hand in hand. The same government lab that originally developed the fertilizer that fueled the Cerrado’s cultivation has now been tasked with creating an improved version to significantly increase crop yield, so economic growth can be maintained without surrendering more land. Technology can both harm us and save us, the great roulette wheel of the modern world. So far, progress has been modest, with the leaders of Brazil more actively enforcing environmental protections to slow the rate of deforestation. Meanwhile, plenty of historic grassland continues to be plowed over. There appears to be a reluctance among legislators to enact regulations that will likely harm finances. And the agribusiness, undeniably, is helping keep the economy of Brazil, and the globe, rolling along. At the same time, the National Campaign in Defense of the Cerrado and science journalists have reported about the particularly convenient and widespread belief that nothing is really being lost—agricultural lobbyists have indicated to legislators that the Cerrado’s last untouched places are little but infertile, uninhabited regions just waiting to turn a profit. (Discover the aquatic paradise where dorados swim freely.) Luciana Santos begs to differ. She was born in the Cerrado and lives there still, with her husband and four young daughters. Her family is part of a community, a collection of villages known as a quilombo, whose first members escaped slavery some 250 years ago. Here, enfolded into the hills just beyond the boundaries of Chapada dos Veadeiros National Park, the roads remain unpaved, and electricity hasn’t yet reached the farthest thatch-roofed homes. Santos is 33 years old; when she was young, she had to walk two hours to get to school each way, though her daughters don’t do that—there’s a new school in her village that becomes a community library at night. Currently, there are 44 separate quilombos in the Cerrado and about 80 different Indigenous ethnicities whose ancestors stretch back to pre-European times. Some hunt, some farm, some fish, some graze livestock. Everyone sings different songs. An accurate census of the Cerrado is elusive, but about 100,000 people are believed to live traditionally off the land. Several groups do not own the legal deeds to their territory, their future destined to be fraught with lawsuits and land battles. The community Santos comes from has embraced tourism. Sharing the Cerrado, they believe, helps save it. They don’t want bulldozers approaching their hills; they have everything to lose. Any visitors willing to take the long drive from Brasília are welcome. Santos is one of the guides. Walking the footpaths around her quilombo, she sees through the chaos of shrubs and trees and bushes, indecipherable to most outsiders, and points out ingredients she regularly uses. “These leaves make a lotion for skin care,” she says. “Brew a tea with this for muscle ache. This one’s good for bug bites.” Tiny black frogs dart abruptly across the path. “They do that when it’s about to rain,” she says, and a few minutes later it does. Santos gained her knowledge of the natural world from her grandmother and mother—“and some from men too, but they’re harder to learn from”—and vows that she will pass on everything to her daughters. “I will not allow our culture to die.” Prepackaged goods occasionally arrive by truck, but her community, like every quilombo, can grow all its own food. They did it for a couple of centuries, coaxing the soil to yield rice, beans, pumpkins, cassava. Nothing is sprayed with pesticides. You can drink the water right out of the streams. Chickens and cows are raised for meat, rivers provide fish, berries are plentiful. Buriti palm trees offer roofing material and creamy fruits. Mangaba trees produce plumlike, sugary treats. But the local favorite, Santos says, is definitely the pequi—a fruit native to the Cerrado that’s a little complicated and a touch dangerous to eat, as there are needlelike spines inside that must be carefully avoided. The flavor, a trace of bitter lemon and a hint of cheddar cheese, doesn’t immediately appeal to everyone, but for those who can adapt to the taste, the pequi often becomes a prized delicacy. The pequi, Santos implies, is like the Cerrado itself. If you’re able to adjust in just the right ways, the prickliness and oddities are not merely tolerated but deeply adored. “I have never wanted to live anywhere else,” she says. One person’s wasteland is another’s wonder. Witnessing the Cerrado’s wild glory, while also avoiding the afternoon heat, sometimes requires departing with a guide on the national park trails before dawn. Moths flit about your headlamp, crystal fragments glint in the dark. There is a crazy amount of noise. Frogs burp, crickets squeak. A cacophony of insects greets first light. Some sound like power tools, others like kazoos, and whistles, and buzzers—a sense of teeming, infinite life. Everywhere are twisted tree branches, the Cerrado staple, and vines dangling down like loose wires. From the undergrowth, ferns stretch their herringbone fronds toward the light. Brilliant splashes of color pop from the greenery: purple jasmine, red hibiscus. A candle bush holds up bright yellow blooms, a grand chandelier. A blue morpho butterfly circles, flying stained glass. The air is a heavy blanket, and a loamy scent lingers. Termite mounds shaped like witches’ hats rise from the soil. A fat lizard lumbers, tongue flitting. Black ants hauling hunks of leaves to their nest look like a procession of tiny windsurfers. A breeze-triggered confetti of white petals tumbles out of a tree. Birds are constant companions—parakeets, hummingbirds, flycatchers, hawks. A toucan bobs beak-heavy through the air as if swimming the breaststroke. A pair of flamboyant macaws, mated for life, rainbow over the treetops. (This unorthodox method is saving baby macaws from extinction.) The trail steepens up a bouldery slope, and a sound like rolling thunder starts and doesn’t stop. It only intensifies, soon drowning out even the bugs. Then the forest parts at a rocky outcrop on top of a hill, and there it all is: an expansive sweep of untouched Cerrado, not a farm in sight, the green wilderness sliced open by a deep, cliff-walled canyon, the river within hurtling off a stairway of ledges. The raging waterfalls, the source of the thunder, kick up clouds of mist; the sheer breadth of the view is dizzying and spectacular, the heart of Brazil still beating strong. But for how long? The director of Chapada dos Veadeiros National Park, a 37-year-old biologist named Nayara Stacheski, says she is fearful. The Cerrado could pass any salvageable tipping point in less than a decade. “This could all become a desert,” she says, and everyone with a stake in the Cerrado will lose. Many Brazilian scientists who specialize in the Cerrado are in general agreement: It’s hard to halt, or even slow, the march of progress and the force of consumerism. “I’m not optimistic,” says Guarino Colli, an ecology professor at the University of Brasília who studies the Cerrado’s lizards and snakes. Colli indicates that it’s not the celebrated areas like the Amazon rainforest, for which people are willing to donate money and fight to protect, that we should worry about, but rather it is the lesser known, vulnerable lands that could determine our fate. How we treat the Cerrado is, by extension, how we will treat much of the world. What’s at risk, according to the National Campaign in Defense of the Cerrado, “is the life of every being.” There are no simple solutions. Everyone wants inexpensive commodities; if we don’t farm the Cerrado, we will have to farm elsewhere. Eight billion people need to be fed every day. All nations seek to grow their economy. Nobody is at fault and everybody’s at fault at the same time. “We all have some responsibility for the devastation of the Cerrado,” says Colli. Soybean demand is soaring, and the expansion of farmland will almost surely continue. The lure of cheap cheeseburgers is strong. The Cerrado, it’s possible, will be a place that few will really miss, until it’s closed forever and gone.
