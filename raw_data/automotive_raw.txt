TITLE: Tariffs, Even If Delayed, Could Get Big Reactions from the Auto Companies
DATE: Published: Mar 7, 2025
CONTENT:
The Trump administration has placed a 30-day moratorium on tariffs for USMCA-compliant goods coming from Canada and Mexico, which will end on April 2. The further delay raises questions as to how Ford, GM, and Stellantis will respond to the federal government's goal of moving production to the United States, which some industry analysts think may not work. A report by Automotive News shows that roughly one-third of U.S. auto parts suppliers said they would move production outside of the U.S. if 25 percent tariffs on Canada and Mexico stay in place for six months. The AN report cites a February survey conducted by MEMA Original Equipment Suppliers, a company that represents U.S. auto parts manufacturers.  In the study, more than 80 percent of American suppliers surveyed said tariffs on Mexico would negatively impact their business while more than two-thirds said the same about tariffs on Canada, according to AN. Nearly a quarter of surveyed suppliers said they would cut or delay investments if tariffs lasted just a month. If the tariffs were to last for six months, nearly half of the surveyed suppliers said, they would cut U.S. jobs. Given the short time frame offered by the new moratorium and the huge amounts of capital needed to move production, don't expect to see the automakers taking concrete steps on that one in the next few weeks. However, we can expect some to make announcements about their investments in the U.S., said Sam Abuelsamid, an analyst for the Telemetry market-research firm. Abuelsamid pointed to an investment plan outlined by Apple in 2021 that included a $5 billion data center in North Carolina. "Most of that money was already planned for the normal course of business anyway and would have been spent regardless," said Abuelsamid. The playbook will likely be the same for automakers whose business outlook tends to be years down the road, rather than weeks or months. MEMA president Collin Shaw expressed similar sentiments to AN, saying it would be "categorically false" to suggest automakers could move production in a matter of months. "It’s a multiyear journey, at least two years to move production from location to location," Shaw said. Car and Driver reached out to Ford, General Motors, and Stellantis for comment on the exemption and we have listed their responses below. GM's statement on the exemption: "We thank President Trump for his approach, which enables American automakers like GM to compete and invest domestically. With more vehicle assembly plants in the U.S. than any other automaker, GM has invested over $60 billion since the USMCA took effect, and we continue to invest billions of dollars every year in our manufacturing base, supply chain, and U.S. jobs. We are committed to continued growth and delivering winning vehicles to American consumers." Ford's statement: "As America's top auto producer, we appreciate President Trump's work to support our industry and exempt auto companies complying with USMCA. Since President Trump's successful USMCA was signed, Ford has invested billions in the United States and committed to billions more in the future to both invest in American workers and ensure all of our vehicles comply with USMCA. We will continue to have a healthy and candid dialogue with the Administration to help achieve a bright future for our industry and U.S. manufacturing." Stellantis's statement: "We thank President Trump for the decision to grant a one-month exemption from tariffs to USMCA-compliant products. We strongly support his determination to enable the American automotive sector to thrive, and in the first 100 hours of his new Administration we announced major investments to grow our business in America. Since the USMCA was enacted in his first term, we invested billions in our U.S. activities and U.S. suppliers. We share the President's objective to build more American cars and create lasting American jobs. We look forward to working with him and his team." Jack Fitzgerald’s love for cars stems from his as yet unshakable addiction to Formula 1. 
After a brief stint as a detailer for a local dealership group in college, he knew he needed a more permanent way to drive all the new cars he couldn’t afford and decided to pursue a career in auto writing. By hounding his college professors at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, he was able to travel Wisconsin seeking out stories in the auto world before landing his dream job at Car and Driver. His new goal is to delay the inevitable demise of his 2010 Volkswagen Golf.

TITLE: 2025 Chevy Blazer vs. Honda Passport vs. Nissan Murano
DATE: Published: Mar 9, 2025
CONTENT:
There are plenty of good two-row mid-size SUVs to choose from today. So many, in fact, that it can be tough getting a handle on what's out there. Models in this segment provide a combination of interior space and utility without being truly huge and unwieldy, and their fuel-efficiency numbers are a little more palatable than full-size options. We've selected three popular entrants in this crowded class to help you cross-shop them. Here, we'll look at how 2025 models of the Chevy Blazer, the Honda Passport, and the Nissan Murano stack up in terms of specs and pricing. As part of a big 2025 update, the Murano saw its former V-6 and continuously variable automatic transmission (CVT) replaced by a more modern powertrain. In place of the old 3.5-liter six is Nissan's turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder featuring variable compression and variable displacement. The VC-Turbo, as it's marketed, makes 241 horsepower and 260 pound-feet of torque. Backing it is a conventional nine-speed automatic transmission that behaves much more civilly than the CVT. Front-wheel drive is standard, with all-wheel drive available as an option. Honda's Passport still has a 3.5-liter V-6 underhood, providing a smooth 280 horsepower and 262 pound-feet of torque. The sole transmission offered is a nine-speed automatic, and a torque-vectoring all-wheel-drive system is standard. A new Passport is coming for 2026; it uses a version of the corporate V-6 powertrain paired with a 10-speed auto. The Chevy Blazer offers a rare amount of choice in this segment, with two available powertrains. The standard offering is a turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder that puts out 228 horsepower and 258 pound-feet of torque. A 3.6-liter V-6 is optional and brings considerably higher output: 308 horsepower and 270 pound-feet of torque. Both engines mate with a nine-speed automatic transmission and come with a choice of standard front- or available all-wheel drive. Chevrolet also offers the Blazer EV, which, despite the shared name, is really a separate model of a similar size. Despite its new efficiency-focused powertrain, the 2025 Murano merely matches the 23 mpg combined fuel-economy number of last year's V-6-powered model, with 21 city and 27 highway numbers for both the front- and all-wheel-drive versions. The more rugged Honda Passport doesn't fare as well. Its V-6 returns 19 mpg in the city and 24 mpg on the highway in EPA testing. The 2025 Blazer's two powertrains' fuel-economy ratings line up well with their competitors in this set. The four-cylinder model is rated at 22 mpg in the city and 29 mpg on the highway with front-wheel drive, while all-wheel drive drops the highway figure slightly, with ratings of 22 city and 27 highway. Opt for the V-6, and the front-drive Blazer manages 19 city and 26 highway in EPA tests, while the all-wheel-drive V-6 version has the same highway rating and is close behind for the city at 18. In Car and Driver's 75-mph highway fuel-economy test, an all-wheel-drive V-6 Blazer returned 24 mpg. All three of these contenders provide seating for five people in two rows. Unlike some other mid-sizers, the Blazer, the Passport, and the Murano do not offer an available third row. Passenger space in the Nissan favors the first row, with 44.3 inches of legroom up front and 36.3 in the rear. The Chevy and Honda offer more balanced accommodations with about 41 inches up front and an identical 39.6 in the rear. The Passport is by far the winner when it comes to cargo volume with all seats up. It offers a generous 41.2 cubic feet, while the Nissan comes in at 32.9 and the Chevy at 30.5. Fold down the second row, and the rankings are as follows: 77.7 cubic feet in the Passport (77.5 for the Black Edition trim), 64.2 in the Blazer, and 63.5 cubes in the Murano. These are all respectable numbers, but the Honda has an obvious advantage for those who want to maximize stuff-carrying abilities. Each of these options offers enough trailer-towing capacity for light recreational use—think a pop-up camper, small watercraft, or a utility trailer. The Passport is rated for a 5000-pound trailer, while 2.0-liter Blazers can handle 1500 to 3250 pounds, depending on equipment, and the V-6 versions can handle 1500 to 4500 pounds. The Murano offers just 1500 pounds of trailering, so it's not quite the lifestyle vehicle the others are. The least expensive of these three is also the least powerful—a Blazer 2LT with front-wheel drive and the 2.0-liter engine starts at $36,795, while an all-wheel-drive version tacks on $2700. Going for the V-6 Blazer requires $44,395 for a front-drive RS model, and adding all-wheel drive to that version runs an extra $2900. The 2025 Murano SV FWD comes in at $41,860, with an all-wheel-drive version just $1000 more. The Honda Passport EX-L starts at $43,850, but remember that everything in that lineup comes with all-wheel drive from the start, making the Passport a bit less expensive than a V-6 Blazer.

TITLE: Best Cars for Uber Black: Window Shop with Car and Driver
DATE: Published: Mar 7, 2025
CONTENT:
On this week's Window Shop, we embark on a mission to find the best cars for Uber Black. This challenge came from a viewer and proved to be somewhat difficult, given a budget of $20,000 and the rather tight restrictions of Uber's vehicle requirements for this premium service. Eligible vehicles have to have a black exterior and a black leather interior and be less than five years old (though some 2019 model vehicles are eligible). As usual, our contestants took a wide variety of strategies for this task, and the resulting range of vehicles proved to be entertaining. Yours truly started off with a subdued long-wheelbase Swedish luxury sedan. Then, senior editor Elana Scherr took a sharp left turn with her sporty Italian SUV, which may not have a very big back seat but would no doubt impress riders with its fancy-sounding name. Executive editor K.C. Colwell was up next and found an impressively trimmed flagship sedan from an unlikely source. Contributor Jonathon Ramsey went the more traditional route with a rather anonymous SUV that nonetheless boasted both a luxury badge and a third row of seats, possibly opening it up for UberXL duty as well. And editor-in-chief Tony Quiroga presented a self-described "cynical" choice that was quite literally a former livery vehicle. We don't want to give away too many spoilers, but this episode did feature a fun twist ending with a tiebreaker and an impromptu special guest. So we implore you to stick around until the bitter end and share your thoughts on which vehicle you thought was the winner. Despite being raised on a steady diet of base-model Hondas and Toyotas—or perhaps because of it—Joey Capparella nonetheless cultivated an obsession for the automotive industry throughout his childhood in Nashville, Tennessee. He found a way to write about cars for the school newspaper during his college years at Rice University, which eventually led him to move to Ann Arbor, Michigan, for his first professional auto-writing gig at Automobile Magazine. He has been part of the Car and Driver team since 2016 and now lives in New York City.

TITLE: 10Best Trucks for 2025: All the Winning SUVs, Trucks, and Vans
DATE: Published: Dec 3, 2024
CONTENT:
Go To 2025 10Best Cars From the January/February 2025 issue of Car and Driver. The discussion around this year's 10Best Trucks competition had some editors wishing the award were called 12Best. The crop of excellent family (or whatever) haulers grew by leaps and bounds, while last year's winners, including some models that are getting quite old, aged  gracefully. The need for nanometer-scale scrutiny has never been higher. Thankfully, we have a great evaluation process in place—the exact same one we use for cars, in fact. After two long weeks of driving everything new that's not a car around our evaluation loop and creating roostertails on dirt roads, we settled on the 10 vehicles that best fulfill their intended mission while still being a joy to drive. Click each individual car to get the full story, or keep reading to find out more about the 2025 10Best trucks. read more read more read more read more read more read more read more read more read more read more In recent years, Chevys have earned 10Best crowns numerous times. Camaros and Corvettes have blazed their way onto our list thanks to their thumping V-8 power, tarmac-warping acceleration, viscera-rearranging handling, and ripped physiques. The subcompact Trax crossover shares none of those characteristics. It's brilliant nonetheless. While we love cars with outsize personalities and big power, we also celebrate any vehicle that nails its mission, and it's especially noteworthy if the vehicle's intended purpose is to provide basic transportation at an affordable, high-value price point. The Trax is that rarest of things, an inexpensive vehicle that delivers greatness and value with surprising style and grace. READ MORE In retrospect, it's hard to believe it took the Ford Maverick so long to arrive. After all, the only thing America likes better than a pickup truck is a great deal. The Maverick, by no random feat, is both. Launched into a void in the market, the Maverick was conceived not only as compact pickup but also as an answer to a question that had been brewing in consumer minds for years: Why can't I get an affordable, efficient pickup—something as practical as a Toyota Corolla or Honda CR-V but with a bed? Make no mistake: The Maverick could've been a flop or even worse, relegated to novelty status if Ford got it wrong. READ MORE For some reason that makes us wonder about the decision-making processes inside the Ford Motor Company, the Ford Ranger Raptor's first generation didn't make it stateside, despite our country's indefatigable infatuation with pickup trucks. With the second generation reaching our shores, we finally get a bite of the apple and find that the Ranger Raptor is even tastier than it looked from afar. With blistered fenders and a long-travel suspension, the Ranger Raptor follows the same Baja-inspired formula as the full-size F-150 Raptor. But the concept is easier to live with in mid-size pickup form, especially when navigating tight trails, maneuvering through parking lots, or fitting into a standard garage. read more The biblical book of Genesis is usually broached when discussing beginnings—you know, light and dark, land and sea, cattle and cuttlefish in seven days or so. But this opening chapter covers a mighty span, extending to Adam and Eve, Cain and Abel, Noah and his menagerie, the tower of Babel, Abraham and Sarah and Isaac, and the 12 tribes of Israel. That's a surprisingly meaty opening act, a slow burn from formlessness to a cast of star players subtly resetting the landscape. Turns out the Genesis brand has mimicked that story arc. It started with the Hyundai Concept Genesis in 2003; it culminates in today's lineup of seriously impressive sedans and SUVs, and particularly this Genesis GV70. read more The Honda CR-V takes much of what we love about the 39-time 10Best-winning Accord and combines those characteristics with the versatility of an SUV's rear liftgate and elevated seating position. Both functional and fun to drive, the CR-V meets the moment by catering to today's SUV-obsessed buying public while maintaining a dynamic prowess that rivals that of its lighter and lower mid-size sedan stablemate. Need a vehicle to haul people or cargo ably? With a low step-in height, the square-bodied CR-V is easy to get into and out of and offers plenty of headroom and legroom for those seated in the front or rear. Meanwhile, a low lift-over height makes it easy to load up to 12 carry-on suitcases in the cargo hold. Fold down the reclining backs of the 60/40 split-folding rear bench, and the CR-V practically becomes a miniature cargo van with its ability to swallow 28 carry-ons. read more The Hyundai Ioniq 5 won our EV of the Year award not once but twice, so its continued inclusion on our 10Best Trucks and SUVs list may seem like a foregone conclusion. But Hyundai isn't resting on its laurels. Even though the Ioniq 5 has been our most decorated electric SUV since its debut, in the spirit of continuous improvement, Hyundai treated the 2025 model to numerous updates. Hyundai fixed flaws big and small. The 2025 model now has a rear wiper, a feature missing on our 2023 long-term car. It seems like a minor change, but without it, the rear glass became grimy enough to block the rear view in winter. Inside, several interior controls are now easier to use. Range is up too, with the longest-range version now hitting an EPA-estimated 318 miles. READ MORE Mainstream three-row crossovers aren't exactly thin on the ground these days, but very few capture our interest, and none have sustained that attention like the Kia Telluride. A 10Bester since it hit the market for 2020, and with a revamped version expected for 2026, the Telluride is the rare vehicle that maintains its crown through an entire generation. Endurance is nothing trivial in this business. One word—"still"—kept popping up in C/D editors' notes on the Telluride. Put simply, the Telluride was great when new, and it remains every bit as strong today. Competitors have had ample time to analyze and attempt to emulate, yet none have exceeded its overall goodness. READ MORE  Betting on the Porsche Macan being a part of 10Best is like betting on the tide—it's one of the surest wagers out there. As an electric variant begins to make its way into the marketplace, there's still plenty of room to celebrate the original Macan, which continues to delight us. Senior editor Eric Stafford minced no words in his logbook entry: "[The Macan] has the best steering, best powertrain, best design, best chassis, and best driving position of any SUV here." The entire Macan range is great—we're excited to introduce you to our long-term Macan T in the near future—but at 10Best, we were privy to one of our favorite variants overall, the GTS. This model carries a twin-turbocharged 2.9-liter V-6 making a meaty 434 horsepower and 405 pound-feet of torque, which ships to all four wheels by way of a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic. READ MORE  "We try harder." That was the longtime tagline of number-two rental-car giant Avis, but it seems to have been adopted by Stellantis engineers and product planners tasked with creating the current Ram 1500. Though it's hard to think of the towering Ram 1500 pickups as standing in anyone's shadow, the brand was mired in number-three sales status when this truck was in development. The try-harder mantra provided the green light for unconventional chassis tech that transforms the driving experience: a coil-sprung rear axle and, optionally available, air springs at all four corners. Add an interior that leaves good-enough far behind, instead embracing design and materials that befit the full-size pickup's emerging status as luxury vehicle writ large and incorporate uncommonly user-friendly technology, and it all comes together to create a pickup that vaults ahead of better-selling rivals. READ MORE Minivans aren't supposed to make a statement. A minivan is supposed to blend in and go unnoticed. When minivans try to be cool, the effect is like a dad co-opting teen slang—specifically, the word "cringe." That's because a van's pragmatic mission is fundamentally at odds with the fantasies of adventure that lend a pretext of cool to the minivan's outdoorsy rival, the three-row SUV. Extolling the virtues of a minivan is an exercise in proving a negative—you didn't get annoyed while driving five kids to a birthday party. And while there is luxury in competence, there's not much romance. We would have said this was an unsolvable problem until we drove the 2025 Volkswagen ID.Buzz, a rolling transgression against minivan dogma. read more Cars are Andrew Krok’s jam, along with boysenberry.

TITLE: 2025 Nissan Z Isn't More Expensive and Adds an Iconic Paint Color
DATE: Published: Mar 7, 2025
CONTENT:
While you can no longer order a new GT-R, Nissan will still sell you another sports car, and it's not more expensive than last year's model. Along with pricing details, we've learned the 2025 Nissan Z is now available with a trio of fresh color options, including a truly iconic shade. For 2025, the Z still starts at $44,110. That's a helluva deal compared with its chief rival, the 2025 Toyota GR Supra, which dropped the standard turbo four that previously had a $47,575 initial ask. Now, the GR Supra 3.0 with the 382-hp turbocharged straight-six starts at $57,385. For about $13K less, the entry-level Nissan Z comes with rear-wheel drive and a 400-hp twin-turbo six, not to mention an optional six-speed manual. The Z's mid-tier Performance trim, which starts at $54,110, comes with additional go-fast bits such as a limited-slip rear differential, Bridgestone Potenza S007 high-performance tires, and upgraded brakes. Even the most expensive track-focused Z NISMO, which ups output to 420 horsepower, features a sportier suspension and wears racier bodywork. It starts at $66,890, just like last year. While the Supra has been the mainstream choice and the winner of our comparison test between the two models, it is also now the far more expensive option. Three new exterior color options have also been added to the Z's seven existing hues. Two of them are split-tone options, including one that pairs a Pearl White tri-coat with a Super Black roof, and the other couples a Solid Red shade with the same blacked-out canopy. The third new exterior paint color should excite any longtime Nissan fans, as it isn't a new color at all. The Z can now be ordered in Bayside Blue, one of the most iconic Nissan paint colors of all time, which first appeared on the R34-generation GT-R before also being made available on the most recent R35 GT-R. With the GT-R now cruising the great Bayshore Route in the sky, the not-so-subtle tribute is a nice gesture by Nissan. And between its performance-to-price quotient and new paint options, the latest Z looks more attractive than before.

TITLE: 1980 BMW 733i Tested: Roll Out the Superlatives
DATE: 
CONTENT:
From the June 1980 issue of Car and Driver. Ladies and gentlemen, you will please cue up your Superman tapes, main title passage, please. We are here to tell you about one of those rare cars, of which a few come to each generation, whose presence and capabilities completely transcend even the uppermost limits of accepted goodness. To harness yourself into this car is to lace up Seven League Boots. To drive it well, with skill, con­centration, and energy, is to unleash the miracle of our own genius for progress in transportation. Each time we drive the 733i, then relinquish the key to a neophyte, we find ourselves looking over our shoulders at the one taking its wheel for the first time. Each of us won­ders privately if he is alone in his per­ception of this car's capacity to satisfy our wildest dreams of accomplishment in sedandom. But then the newly initiat­ed driver returns, gets out of the car, and pinches himself. As we have pinched ourselves in the same situation. Aha, we are not alone! We on the staff are expected to foam some at the mouth when a piece like the 733i comes along, but when the boss does, too, well, jeez... When the origi­nal 733i was first made available to us two years ago, frankly The Man's praise button short-circuited in the full-on po­sition. "I'm saved," he said. "I, David E. Davis, Jr., self-appointed high priest of Bimmer Madness in North America, can finally stop feeling guilty about not lik­ing the 630CSi coupe. Forget the coupe! The magnificent 7-series sedans have arrived in America and God's in his heaven and all's right with the world! Damn, what a car...this is Bim­mer Infinity." Right again, Boss-man. What we need here is an automatic typesetter with a key marked "Superlatives." That is the nature of this 733i. It is so good, it makes you feel guilty when you note something even slightly negative about it. And while it's nice to dabble around town in, you will never discover its true delights until you take it out in the open, where the road unreels like a bal­loon with a hole punched in it. Knowing that, we quit Los Angeles and set off for Monterey up the coast on Highway 1 in our Seven League Boots, sidestepping the highway patrol by sixth sense and practiced eye. This is necessary because this car makes you feel like a somnolent old coot if you're not out there thump­ing on it for all you're worth every sec­ond the wheels are turning. BMW has done hand-to-hand combat with the rudiments and the complexities of suspension design, and has come out a winner. The result is a fine cream of consistency, a refinement in the way the car goes about its most trying business that carries through to almost every as­pect of its behavior. The 733i offers a thoroughly civilized give-and-take that returns at least what you put into it. It feels better than the Mercedes 450SEL in its way of going, although it will be interesting to see how the new S-class Mercedes, coming next year, will com­pare. BMW's biggest advance in the 733i's all-independent suspension came in front at its damper-strut linkage. It is located by two separate positioning links instead of the normal (and less ef­ficient) one. Suspension geometry is thus improved, providing less self-steer­ing when the wheels are unequally load­ed, more self-centering for the steering wheel, and less dive under braking. The 733i goes around corners like an overgrown open-wheeled race car, yet it sacrifices nothing in the way of ride quality. It just turns in and tracks around with record low amounts of un­dersteer for a big sedan. It encourages you and serves devotedly in the tightest of switchbacks, and it cuts beautifully clean arcs through great, long sweepers. It is light on its feet and possessed of startling maneuverability and agility, and while its passage can be breathtak­ing from outside, inside, the 733i pro­fesses absolute calmness and gives time for clearheaded perception. BMW's characteristic trailing-throttle oversteer, a normal byproduct of semi-trailing-arm rear suspension, has been throttled back, although it's still provokable. Log­ic has it that the 733i's very low levels of initial and final understeer help reduce final oversteer because, even entering corners more quickly, it will track around with less addition of steering lock (which tends to initiate an outward swing of the tail with the turning in of the nose), and have much less need to close the throttle (thus avoiding the in­herent steering outward of the semi­-trailed rear wheels), which is the likely way to slow down a car that first threat­ens to go straight on in corners. Dips and bumps pass under BMW's suspension calibrations like low water under a tall bridge, the 733i flowing over the road as if it were the world's fastest hovercraft. Its directional stabili­ty seems somehow related to the path and character of unrefracted light, un­wavering and true. The degree of steer­ing assist is determined by road speed, and its subjective feel may outqualify Mercedes' as the best in the world. The BMW's steering has slightly less feel, but it also take less effort, nearly perfect effort. We dream about having this no­-muss, no-fuss steering response in se­dans, and discovering it here feels as reassuring and familiar as pocketing your favorite penknife in the morning. Thank God for that. California was just entering its record-breaking rain-­flood-and-mudslide season when we picked up the 733i. Amid the stop-and-­go traffic and the impending, soggy collapse of the coastal range, the car never missed a beat. Its single flaw, in the face of winds that tore shrieks from damp young ladies clutching disemboweled umbrellas that flopped like one-legged chickens, was a tendency for it to be bat­ted around by these stout gusts. This is Mother Nature's elbow in the ribs of the 733i's superior attitude. Cars that like to change direction when you tell them to sometimes like to do so when they haven't been told, you see, and a stabi­lizing air dam would be a welcome addition beneath the front bumper. Beyond that, the smooth attitude transitions and fishbowl visibility of the 733i make working traffic a breeze. And its Continental radials, in spite of minor out-of-roundness, slice through rainwa­ter and cling to sunbaked pavement with equal finesse, though nothing in their appearance would suggest this combination of virtues. BMW has some­how magically wedded these tires to its suspension, and the 733i flashes as surely up Highway 1 in streaming rain as lesser cars do when it's bone-dry. And in the dry, HO-HO! the 733i plays first chair. It has some tendency to vault through quick cycles of vertical motion over repeated and highly exaggerated ripples, but its speed must be nigh on to ungodly to make this happen, and it re­covers quickly. Most other cars would already have inserted themselves in ditches. When trouble does start, the brakes are at your side. They are hydraulically assisted, shunning the more popular vacuum boost, so they put the squeeze on very quickly, without deliberation but with great consistency. They have tremendous feel, easily defining the ul­timate possible degree of braking under every hard-charging circumstance we could induce on our run up the gantlet of Pacific Coast Highway. The brakes are progressive, direct, and firm, a blessing that shuns disguise. They are also called for. It is no surprise that the engine is a thing of wonder. This is a BMW. It is expected, and BMW has smote our gov­ernment's emissions and mileage re­quirements with research and develop­ment. The research has turned up a three-way catalyst, a Lambda-sensor, and unleaded fuel, and the develop­ment is horsepower. The expensive and sophisticated six-cylinder engine it's housed in is the mechanical embodiment of absolute insistence. It has a pas­sion for accelerating the countryside past as if it were wired to a well-man­nered-but-berserk, Jekyll-and-Hyde rhe­ostat. It pulls beautifully through the gears, and when the power band of its overhead cam comes on, it begins to howl. It says you could never ask too much. And lordy, does it give. You may wonder that 3.2 liters can wallop 3600 pounds of prime Bavarian comfort up to 60 mph in 8.2 seconds, and cover the quarter-mile in 16.3 seconds at 84 mph, but believe it. The 6400-rpm redline, if you're in the grasp of neck-and-neck fe­ver, won't bid you goodbye in third gear until 97 mph, and running flat-scat over the open road packs your sensory load­ings to overflowing. This raises impolite questions such as, "How come other automakers can't seem to do this?" and, un­fortunately, "Do they even want to?" BMW's EPA mileage number is 16 mpg, but we'd say you could probably do better with restraint. Even so, your mileage won't be terrific. This car needs a five-speed, with fifth an overdrive. At least there isn't a nicer four-speed around, and finding one in here at all is reward enough. This is sig­nificant because there aren't any other luxury cars that come with manual gear­boxes over here. BMW, of course, has an automatic too, but the stick shift is the tip. Our engine ran so smoothly that we used the gears too hard, too soon, and it wasn't long before the box was audibly reminding us of our shortsight­edness. Gear noise is not normally a problem, but proper break-in, as we know from other experiences with BMWs, is very important. Inside this 110-inch wheelbase is enough room for the Jabbar family up front and a non-contact soccer match in back. We stretch the point, but the space is all here. The leather seats are at first very comfortable and they are ad­justable for any angle or attitude from foxhole to crow's-nest. But the leather is slick, lumbar adjustments are missing, and marathon drivers seem to wind up with minor backaches. But support for hard driving is good, and the back seat is a place of airy comfort despite still more slippery leather. BMW's four-spoke leather wheel is in-out adjustable. The dash layout, con­trols, and ventilation are worth the price of admission, and there are separate ventilation controls for the back seat. Our only real complaints cover the two-­tone dash treatment—black above, out-­of-place gray below—and the lack of engine-function gauges. A good Blau­punkt AM/FM/cassette unit puts out four-speaker stereo, and a central lock­ing system buttons up everything that can be opened except the ashtrays and the huge, fold-down glove box. The electric sunroof seized open once, as still more rain approached, and then it inexplicably freed itself just in time to fend off another downpour. Outside, the 733i is a solid citizen of upright appearance, but it could use a deft pinstripe around the beltline crease for the sake of definition. Its solidity of construction needs no extra help. The 733i, in terms of driving satisfaction, is certainly worth more than $10,000 less than a 450SEL. And one of these days, one of these 733is will burst up behind you, slashing at your heels. Capitulate and move over. This may not give you the view you'd like, but it's the second-­best suggestion we've got, the other be­ing to fork over big money and plug in your Superman tapes. Before I wax hyperbolic about the 733i, I think there are a few sobering facts you ought to consider: compared with a Pontiac Bonneville, the 733i has one fewer seats, gets 2 mpg less, and costs $21,971 more. And you have to shift it yourself? Most Bonneville buyers probably think that shelling out nearly 30 grand for any car—let alone one that makes you stir the gears—is about as dumb as buying land by mail. Value, of course, is in the bank account of the beholder. But if you can stretch your credit far enough for a high-roller luxo-sedan, you won't find more satisfaction than in the 733i. It's a cornucopia of driving delights, from the way it moves—arrogantly assured, superbly responsive—to its carved-from-a-single-billet construction. From behind the wheel of a 733i you survey the vehicular world as if from a snowcapped peak in the Bavarian Alps. And to drive it is to know all the wonderful things machines can do for man. Which is a sense makes the 733i a pretty good deal. After all, it may cost $30,000 but it make you feel like a million. Make that two million. —Rich Ceppos So what we have here is the wonder of the ages, right? The perfect automobile. You've just read reams on how exquisite the 733i is, and the people who have been telling you all these wondrous things are card-carrying automotive experts. Still, you're a little skeptical. Philosophy 101 taught you that nothing is ever as it seems. And you're right. All is not perfect in 733i land, and I would be remiss if I didn't take this opportunity to reveal the truth. Yes, the engine and transmission are perhaps the most delightful tandem you can own. And the instrument panel is an aesthetic and ergonomic delight. Oh, sure, the suspension offers the best combination of luxury ride and handling available. And, yes, the car's looks, solid feel, and general over-the-road competence are unmatched in even the best Mercedes-Benz has to offer. But what about the driver's side floor mat? I'll tell you what. It doesn't fit. It snags on the clutch pedal. No matter how you move it around. Can you believe it? Inexcusable. —Mike Knepper This is the third 7-series BMW I've driven since our friends in Munich introduced their Mercedes-zerstörer, and it's the first one I didn't like so much. The electric sunroof so compromises front-seat headroom that I was always uncomfortable driving the car—literally a pain in the neck, she was. Given the lack of headroom, I then found it impossible to get the seat adjusted to my taste. Mercedes-Benz, Jaguar, Volvo, Saab, and the GM X-cars all provide me with enough headroom for the hat of my choice—why not BMW's 733i? The engine is strong and willing, but the one in our test car had a period of vibration in the midrange that would send me bitching and grumbling to my BMW dealer once a week. The four-speed gearbox is a pleasure to use, but it needs a fifth speed, since the engine really begins to intrude at radar-detector cruising speeds. Perhaps I'm being tough on the luxus-Bimmer because I just spent ten days in an XJ6 Jaguar. More and more, though, I feel that BMW's business is somewhere south of the 5-series cars. I really like the 320i, and I'm eagerly awaiting the 323. Now, if they'd just build us an all-new 1600. —David E.

TITLE: Nissan GT-R Order Books Close in Japan, Is This Goodbye for Good?
DATE: Published: Mar 7, 2025
CONTENT:
The thump you just heard was the closing of the order book for the Nissan GT-R, and it sounds worryingly authoritative. According to a statement posted on Nissan's Japanese home website, no more orders are being taken for the production of the R35-generation GT-R. Either you already have your name on the list, or you can't get one. Given that Nissan brought back the Z after a short hiatus, there might be a tendency not to worry about it. Plenty of nameplates go away and then return a few years later. In fact, such a situation happened with the Skyline GT-R between the “Kenmeri” GT-R of 1973 and the R32-chassis GT-R of 1989. (Side note: if you're a real GT-R otaku, only the R32 is supposed to get the Godzilla nickname.) However, with that particular 13-year pause, some other hot Skylines filled the gap, whereas the R35-chassis GT-R is a standalone car. And, while Nissan has previously confirmed that there will be a next generation of both the GT-R and the Z, it did so at last year's New York auto show, when the financial picture for the company was not so dire. The current situation, including ending merger talks with Honda, does not look so good. What precious R&D dollars are available need to go towards keeping mainline products competitive rather than an expensive performance flagship. The R35 chassis is so old that JDM versions actually now qualify to be imported into Canada under the country's 15-year rules (we have to wait 25 years in the United States). Nissan tweaked the car here and there over its production run, including many special editions, but it's worth noting that there were only three years of the previous R34. When the R35 first debuted, it was a monster. In its last years, it was starting to look like something of an atomic-breath dinosaur, still very fast but also faded. Beyond concepts, Nissan doesn't seem to have an heir waiting in the wings. Still, there's hope to be found. At the heart of the Z's rebirth was none other than Hiroshi Tamura, who shepherded the R35 into existence. Tamura-san is such a huge fan of the GT-R that he still has the R32 Skyline GT-R that he's owned since he was in his 20s. Even when the accounting department turns off the faucet, the enthusiasts working at a company can manage to keep things moving. For now, at least, the Nissan GT-R is officially dormant, if not indeed dead. Nissan will continue to build the cars that have been ordered, and then it's curtains for the iconic sports car. Here's hoping it's not goodbye forever.

TITLE: 1980 Subaru 1600 4WD Test: Terms of Endearment
DATE: 
CONTENT:
From the August 1980 issue of Car and Driver. The consensus among your obedient staffers is that this little Subaru has an endearing sort of crudeness that makes it rather fun. This is in contrast to the ordinary sort of crudeness found in Dat­sun 310s and old B-210s, which make them rather annoying. Such findings may seem a misdirected exercise to you—right up there with pondering whether Brussels sprouts should be eat­en buttered or creamed, when every­body with even half a sense of taste knows they shouldn't be eaten at all­—but these fine judgment calls are what we get paid for. This little Subaru, for the record, starts life as an "STD 4wd hatchback," the loss leader in Subaru's four-wheel-­drive line, and at a base price of $4799 ($4998 in California), it's the cheapest four-wheel-drive thing available in America. In a time when most plain-va­nilla econoboxes list for more than that, the price alone is quite an attraction. At the same time, such a low price im­plies a pretty Spartan machine; hence the crudeness we spoke of earlier. Your opinion of this car will depend pretty much upon what you expect of it. If you live in snow country or RFD America where the roads don't go everywhere you need to, and therefore want a bud­get-priced go-anywhere car to keep you mobile, you'll probably think this is the best automobile in the world. If you just want some no-fuss utility box for get­ting around the country and your stan­dards of presentability require hosing out the interior once a year, whether it needs it or not, you'll probably think the STD 4wd hatchback is a pretty nifty piece as well. But if you have visions of a jewel-like machine with the sophistica­tion of a BMW and the comfort of a Rabbit (or even of an American pickup), you'll certainly have to go higher in the Subaru line—say, to the DL model we used for photography—or possibly to another store. Because the base four­-wheel-driver is a bit of an automotive hair shirt. Five years ago its creature comforts would have made it competitive with any budget import, but now they are substandard. There's absolutely nothing wrong with the four-wheel-drive part, though, at least nothing we discovered in polite motoring. Normally, only the front wheels transmit power. But at any speed up to 50 mph, you may engage 4wd by lifting a healthy-looking lever on the console. When it is pulled fully home, the Honda Accord-style outline draw­ing of a car on the instrument panel comes alive with four green-glowing wheels and an indicator off to the side shows "4wd." That's all there is to it. No drum rolls, fanfares, or transient crunchings from the machinery below. Four-wheel drive manifests itself solely by graphics on the dashboard and, one hopes, a better grip on our planet. This latter, unfortunately, is much harder to measure. The 1595 Subaru ccs under the hood are not noticeably ambitious, so there isn't enough energy available to explore the high-perform­ance possibilities of four-wheel drive in paved-road motoring. The off-road potential of four-wheel drive is, of course, well known, so there seemed little rea­son for us to terrorize the Bambi and bunnies just to report that, yep, four is better than two. All of this is by way of saying that the four-wheel-drive virtue of this car will be left to faith. What we did find is that the personal­ity of this model is substantially differ­ent from that of the four-door, 2wd GL sedan we tested in February. The four­-wheel-driver is much noisier and more subject to vibration. How much of the blame should be apportioned to the four-wheel-drive machinery itself and how much is merely due to the loss-­leader status of the base model we are unable to determine. Moreover, official Subaru spokesmen in this country don't know either. We also found that the sus­pension of this car did not maintain its aplomb on rough pavement. Even with only the driver aboard, it crashed through to the bump stops in a way that modern econoboxes—Rabbits, Omni/Horizons, Hondas, and the like—would never do, which speaks poorly for the off-road potential of this car. Needless to say, such roughriding is not a part of the endearing crudeness, which in itself is a quality not easy to explain and even harder to defend. But some of it has to do with the engine, a horizontally opposed four-cylinder like that of the old Beetle, except this one is water-cooled. As it happens, both make similar sounds, a kind of beating of the exhaust pulses at certain speeds when you accelerate hard, and we found this to be an endearing foible. Then there is the elemental nature of the car itself. The doors, for example, are incredibly light; they feel like two layers of tin with some glass sandwiched in the middle, and that's what they sound like when you slam them. Again, this is hardly praiseworthy, but in the case of a bite-sized four-wheel-driver, it adds a sense of purposefulness that we found appealing. Then, too, there is the one-piece molded-rubber interior. Well, that's an exaggeration, but the entire headliner is one piece of skinned vinyl foam, and each door panel is one piece of formed plastic, and the mats swelling and turn­ing over the countless irregularities in the floor are one-piece, wall-to-wall cre­ations of the most intricate detail. All of this is wonderfully coordinated in a sin­gle hue of cheese-mold gray (we also saw a butterscotch-pudding version). This one-piece theme gets some tricky embellishment on the seats. They're covered entirely in vinyl; however, to disguise that fact the part where you ac­tually sit has been embossed with a black pattern to make it look like woven cloth. But you could still take a hose to it—to the whole interior, for that mat­ter—and that seems kind of endearing. These diverse elements—the nostalgic engine and the tin-can functionality and the Tupperware interior—all combine to give a pearl-of-discount-price feel to the STD 4wd hatchback; this is such a novelty in the car business today that the Subaru manages to be interestingly annoying rather than just plain annoy­ing. Get yourself a shiny new Bronco Ranger XLT and you're afraid to drive it out in the bush because it'll take you a week to pick all the nettles out of the deep-pile carpets. But the Subaru, hell, you just drive it like what it is: a dirt­-cheap, wash-and-wear, go-anywhere car. It's the automotive equivalent of the pair of shoes you change to when it's muddy outside, and you can't argue with the endearing nature of that. You can't find much fault with the hatchback's space utilization either. Considering its mere 93.3-inch wheel­base and truncated, 156.7-inch overall length, there is a great deal of room in­side. The front buckets are good enough for adults of almost any com­mon dimension, and, surprisingly, the rear bench is equally accommodating. There is enough room for heads and knees back there for real people. Or you can fold down the seatback to extend the trunk area forward to the backs of the front seats. The trunk's lift-over height is about medium—the sill line is just above the taillights—but it's no worse than on Subaru sedans. To put this car into final perspective, the endearing crudeness we spoke of earlier is not all that dissimilar to what you find in typical Japanese pickups. And since those devices are regarded as acceptable transport by what seems like millions of Americans these days, the STD 4wd hatchback is certainly not too rough and ready for an important seg­ment of the nation's drivers. All in all, we think this car is really quite an attractive alternative to a small four-wheel-drive pickup. Its over-the-road handling is much easier to live with than that of a truck; the driving position offers much more room where it's need­ed by long American limbs; and the rear seat folds down to make a substantial cargo area—not big enough for a mo­torcycle, true enough, but if your toys are smaller they will enjoy the security of a locked hatch, which no pickup of­fers. And finally, this little skate is well over a grand cheaper than any four-­wheel-drive pickup you can name, ex­cept for Subaru's own BRAT. So the 4wd hatchback, it seems to us, poses two choices: you approach it ei­ther as a rude little car that will go any­where, or as a wonderfully sophisticated near-pickup. Subaru is much like Mercedes-Benz, in that both firms have a crystal-clear vision of who they are and what they ought to be building. I don't know the Japanese word for "leitmotif," but that's what they have, and it works for Subaru just as well as it works for the Germans. I'm keen on Su­barus because they don't make any bones about what kinds of car they are, or what they're supposed to do. This means that it is unheard of for someone who doesn't want a Subaru to wind up owning one. There are Subaru people, and they were meant to own Subarus. They'll feel un­comfortable and unloved in a something-­for-everyone car like a Chevrolet Malibu, but they'll feel as if they've just snuggled into Grandma's lap the minute they sit down behind the wheel of our Subaru three-door and fire up the scrappy little terrier-motor. This is a deadly-serious little car, but it's so much fun to wail around in that I don't know how to cate­gorize it. It may be the most useful little car around. Usefulness abounds in the rear hatch, four-wheel drive, fold-down rear seat, great gas mileage, robust per­formance, and the ratio of interior space to the overall bulk of the vehicle. And it doesn't even look funny. —David E. Davis.Jr. Subaru, I'm happy to see, knows exactly when to mess around with a good thing. The first generation of breadbox all­-wheel-drivers was a great idea, but there was plenty of room left for improvement. The Mark II version attends to every one of the old model's shortcomings—but there is one caveat. While the new 4wd sedan has taken a quantum leap ahead in room, comfort, appearance, and road manners, it still gives away a chunk of refinement to Subaru's revitalized, standard-issue front-drive models. For some reason the 4wd's en­gine seems far coarser, the ride is choppi­er, and on the highway it's a buzz box. One more trip through finishing school is needed to make it a first-class small car. The Subaru's saving grace, of course, is the magic lever between the seats. Having four-wheel drive on your side means nev­er having to worry about Mother Nature. And the Subaru's easy way with fuel makes Blazer-class rigs look as dumb as the dirt they drive in. On balance, life with Subaru is a lot nicer the second time around, caveat and all. —Rich Ceppos Subaru used to be the ugly duckling of Japan, a last bastion of the strangely-mis­shapen school of auto design. You'd nev­er guess that fact looking at the 1980 line, however. This company has matured into its graceful-swan mode, and the new cars look so terrific that every old-Subaru owner should rush right out and trade for one. What better opportunity to help beautify America? Beauty isn't the only thing that's been added this year, either: what we have here is the world's first small sedan with four-wheel drive. This is your chance to own a weatherproof run­ner with 23 mpg! And best of all, it looks and acts nothing at all like a truck. The interior is modern, roomy, and comfort­able to live with. The hatchback "trunk" is small but versatile since the rear seat splits and folds. Roadworthiness could be better with a little more steam under the hood and some suspension development, but one forgives these minor shortcom­ings the instant all four wheels bite into a snowdrift or a sand dune. What's more, the best may be yet to come: home-mar­ket 4wd Subarus have two- speed transfer cases. —Don Sherman Specifications 1980 Subaru 1600 4WDVehicle Type: front-engine, 4-wheel-drive, 4-passenger, 2-door hatchback PRICE

TITLE: Future Electric Vehicles: The EVs You'll Soon Be Able to Buy
DATE: Updated: Feb 27, 2025
CONTENT:
Electric cars are the future, and each year we've seen automakers add more EVs to their lineups. Everyone is working on electric vehicles, from well-established existing manufacturers to new names such as Lucid, Canoo, and Rivian. We've compiled a list of every electric vehicle, from concept to production, that isn't available yet but will be soon. Acura's first EV, the ZDX, is built on the bones of the Chevrolet Blazer EV, but Acura’s next electric crossover will roll on a new electric architecture developed by parent company Honda. The new SUV will also revive the RSX name from the early 2000s and wear a sloping roofline for a coupe-like profile. The RSX’s platform will be shared with Honda’s 0-series EVs and the RSX will also be the first vehicle to use Honda’s new operating system, ASIMO OS. The SUV will be built at Honda's new facility in Ohio and will launch in late 2025. —Caleb Miller Honda has partnered up with Sony—yes, the same folks responsible for the PlayStation—for a new brand called Afeela. Its first model, the not-so-creatively named Afeela 1, is set to arrive in 2026. The sedan’s focus is technology, packing an array of screens across the dashboard and a suite of 40 sensors that feed a Level 2+ driver assistance system. The Afeela 1 will come with all-wheel-drive thanks to a pair of 241-hp electric motors and Afeela is aiming for a range of 300 miles. Sales will initially be restricted to California and the only model offered in 2026 will be the $102,900 Signature trim, with the $89,900 Origin trim arriving in 2027. —Caleb Miller Alfa Romeo has confirmed the gas-powered Giulia (seen above) will be revamped in the coming years with an electric powertrain. We expect the base version will make around 350 horsepower, while the Veloce will produce closer to 800 horsepower. The top-of-the-line Giulia will continue to carry the historic Quadrifoglio name and should make upward of 1000 horsepower. The new Giulia will be produced on the Stellantis Group's STLA Large platform, with 800-volt, ultra-rapid charging and a range of up to 500 miles. Recent rumors suggest the Giulia, like the 2025 Dodge Charger, will also be offered with combustion engines. —Jack Fitzgerald Before the next-generation Giulia arrives, Alfa Romeo will launch a new Stelvio. Like Alfa's upcoming sedan, the Stelvio will ride on the STLA Large platform and come with both electric and internal-combustion powertrains. The electric SUV is expected to arrive first, going on sale at some point in 2025. —Caleb Miller Alpine, the French subsidiary of Renault known for lightweight sports cars, plans to enter the U.S. market later this decade with a lineup of EVs. The charge will be spearheaded by the compact A390, sharing a platform with the Nissan Ariya and expected in 2027, along with a more wagon-like A490. A concept for the A390 revealed in 2024 shows sharp styling and a sloping roofline. Alpine also intends to have an electric successor to its A110 coupe as a flagship model while the A310, set to arrive in 2028, will battle the Porsche Taycan.  —Caleb Miller The Audi A6 e-tron will finally arrive in 2025 with aerodynamic bodywork and an array of powertrains. The base model sends 362 hp to the rear wheels and is joined by a 422-hp all-wheel-drive variant and a 543-hp S6 e-tron. The latter will zip to 60 mph in just 3.7 seconds. A 94.4-kWh battery should provide around 350 miles of range, while the PPE platform's 800-volt architecture allows for rapid charging at up to 270 kW. Inside, a curved panel houses a 14.5-inch infotainment screen and an 11.9-inch digital gauge cluster, while the passenger can play games or watch videos on an optional 14.5-inch display. Sales kick off in the spring of next year, with prices starting around $70,000. —Caleb Miller Bentley's first EV will be revealed in 2026, and the luxury automaker is calling it a "luxury urban SUV" that will slot below the gas-powered Bentayga in the luxury automaker's lineup. Although Bentley calls the EV "compact," the new model will still carry imposing proportions, measuring up to 197 inches long. Few details are known about the electric SUV, but it may use the same platform as the upcoming Porsche Cayenne EV. Sales of the Bentley EV should kick off for the 2027 model year. —Caleb Miller Fender flares, a more aggressive stance, and 1136 horsepower will combine to produce the upcoming BMW i5 M, which won't arrive before 2026. The new high-performance four-motor drivetrain will incorporate wheel-by-wheel torque vectoring and brake-by-motor energy regeneration and will be capable of piloted drifting and tank turns where the vehicle can use its prodigious torque output to spin in place. While the more subdued i5 has already debuted—with its own set of high-performance batteries, active steering, and suspension fit for the Nürburgring—we can't help but keep our focus on the angrier i5 M with a drive control unit that's being referred to internally as the "Hand of God." Take the wheel, Jesus. —Austin Irwin The unique-looking Neue Klasse concept revealed in 2023 is expected to preview a future electric iteration of the iconic, long-running BMW 3-Series. The concept debuted a new design language that should spread across the lineup, with a funky evolution of the classic kidney grille. The concept uses experimental e-Ink technology—similar to what you'd find on an eReader tablet—on the window trim that lights up as you approach the car. The simplistic cabin has a full-width screen spanning the dashboard. The car will be built on BMW's next-generation EV platform which promises range improvements of up to 30 percent versus current models. The production version will likely arrive by 2026. —Caleb Miller The upcoming electric version of the BMW 3-series will also spawn an all-electric M3, which will likely become the first full-fat electric M car when it arrives in 2026. The iM3, as we expect it to be called, will ride on BMW’s next-generation EV platform featuring an 800-volt electrical architecture. A quad-motor powertrain should churn out well over 600 horsepower and ensure that the iM3 is appropriately rapid. But the electric M3 will have to be more than just quick—BMW needs to make the iM3 engaging to drive if it expects to capture the attention of enthusiasts, especially since it will live alongside the gas-powered M3 for several years. —Caleb Miller BMW will continue electrifying its lineup with the iX5, an electric counterpart to the mid-size X5 SUV. Instead of using the Neue Klasse platform underpinning the iX3, the iX5 will use an adaptation of BMW’s CLAR platform—currently found beneath the iX electric SUV—which will allow an updated gas-powered X5 to coexist with its electric sibling. The iX5 will feature a next-generation battery with better energy density. The electric SUV should be revealed in late 2026 and go on sale in the U.S. in 2027. BMW is also planning a version with a hydrogen fuel-cell powertrain—co-developed with Toyota—that may become a reality before the end of the decade.  —Caleb Miller BMW's Vision Neue Klasse X concept is expected to reach production in 2025 and will sit below the iX in the lineup, likely wearing the moniker iX3. The concept ushers in BMW's unorthodox new design language, with a thinner interpretation of the iconic "kidney" grille that harkens back to classics like the 2002. Spy photos show that the production design will hew closely to the concept, and the concept's cabin is simplified with a massive screen spanning the width of the dashboard. A new platform reportedly boasts an 800-volt architecture and a 30 percent range improvement over the company's existing EVs. —Caleb Miller Buick revived the nameplate of the 18-foot-long steel sled from 1959 for its new all-electric SUV that's already been on sale in China. The Electra E5 uses GM's Ultium battery platform and is roughly the same size as a Chevy Blazer. An investigation into trademarks may have revealed Buick's future lineup, with filings for Electra E1 through E9. While Buick had originally planned to reveal its first EV in 2024, the vehicle has now been delayed, with the Electra E5's arrival possibly hampered by tariffs on Chinese-built EVs. It's unclear how this change in plans will affect Buick's hopes to put its tri-shield logo atop a fully electric lineup by 2030. —Austin Irwin Cadillac wants to return to the days when the company could call itself the Standard of the World without getting scoffed at. At least that's the plan with the upcoming Celestiq, an extravagant EV that will be built by hand and cost upward of $300K. That price puts it out of reach for all but the wealthiest people, but Cadillac envisions the Celestiq as aspirational rather than attainable. For the one percent who can afford one of these avant-garde 600-hp electric hatchbacks, each example can be uniquely tailored to the customer's whims. Will it be enough to vault GM's luxury brand into the discussion with Bentley and Rolls-Royce? Production of the Celestiq has begun, but it's unclear when deliveries will start. —Eric Stafford Cadillac is rapidly expanding its EV lineup and will add the three-row Vistiq for 2026 between the mid-size Lyriq and full-size Escalade iQ. The Vistiq looks roughly the size of the gas-powered XT6 and features a similar face to its electric brethren, with slim LED running lights atop vertical headlights and a glossy, illuminated grille trim piece. The first images show a "600E4" badge, suggesting a similar 500-hp, dual-motor, all-wheel-drive powertrain to the most powerful Lyriq model. The Vistiq should launch in early 2025. —Caleb Miller The Corvette cinematic universe is about to plunge into a phase so wild that Marvel might start taking notes. Chevrolet has already confirmed that a fully electric Corvette is coming soon—sooner than we might think since the E-Ray hybrid that recently broke cover was slated to make its debut first. The Corvette EV will use the same Ultium battery platform as other new GM EVs, and considering the General can get a fifty-trillion-ton Hummer EV to reach 60 mph in under 4 seconds, we have high hopes for the Corvette EV. But wait, there's more! We're hearing rumors that the Corvette EV will launch into a new Corvette subbrand within GM, which will bring a host of new Corvette-branded models with it, including a four-door "coupe" and a high-performance crossover, which could easily position itself as a Ford Mustang Mach-E competitor—or something even beefier. —Andrew Krok What doesn't kill you makes you stronger. Or—in the case of the Chevy Bolt—what does kill you makes you stronger. At least that's the outlook of General Motors' CEO, who confirmed the little EV's revival in July. The Bolt will return for a second generation and Chevrolet promised that the electric hatchback will continue to be a tech-centric, affordable option. We know the next-gen Bolt will ride on the Ultium platform, and it should arrive for the 2025 model year. We don't know specifics yet, but we're sure the new version will exceed the current Bolt's EPA-estimated 259-mile range. —Jack Fitzgerald With the success of the Ford Mustang Mach-E in its crosshairs, Chrysler has confirmed an electric crossover is arriving for 2025. The automaker also said that the upcoming EV will differ from the Airflow concept, pictured here. Rumors suggest a 400-mile driving range and Level 3 autonomous driving capability, and we think the electric crossover will be closely related to the upcoming Jeep Wagoneer S. Chrysler, which currently offers the Pacifica minivan, has announced plans to go fully electric by 2028 and may later add an electric sedan based on the Halcyon concept. —Austin Irwin Ferrari is reportedly readying its first fully electric car, which is expected to debut late next year. Ferrari's boss confirmed that prototype testing has already begun and spy shots show a low-riding but crossover-like profile. Not much else is known at the moment but if the SF90 plug-in hybrid pictured here is any indication, the Ferrari EV will likely be incredibly expensive and immensely quick. —Caleb Miller Ford is reportedly delaying its three-row electric SUV, which was expected to bring the iconic Explorer nameplate into the EV era. Ford is instead prioritizing an affordable compact crossover that will start around $25,000 and will ride on a new platform that may also spawn a pickup truck. Ford already sells a small electric crossover in Europe, pictured here, that shares its platform with the Volkswagen ID.4 and confusingly is also called the Explorer. The low-cost U.S.-market EV should be substantially different when it arrives in late 2026. —Caleb Miller Caleb Miller began blogging about cars at 13 years old, and he realized his dream of writing for a car magazine after graduating from Carnegie Mellon University and joining the Car and Driver team. He loves quirky and obscure autos, aiming to one day own something bizarre like a Nissan S-Cargo, and is an avid motorsports fan.

TITLE: 2026 Cadillac Escalade IQL First Look: That's EV for XL or ESV SUV (SMH)
DATE: Mar 04, 2025
CONTENT:
It's the longer version of Cadillac's first-ever all-electric Escalade luxury SUV. Alisa PriddleWriterMar 04, 2025 It's the longer version of Cadillac's first-ever all-electric Escalade luxury SUV. Alisa PriddleWriterMar 04, 2025 See All 11 Photos If rolling large and doing so quietly is your jam, the 2026 Cadillac Escalade IQL could be the answer. If the nomenclature is throwing you off, this is the long wheelbase (L) version of the Escalade IQ, the full-size, all-electric Escalade SUV with three rows and gobs of instant torque and power. Cadillac introduced the Escalade IQ variant for the 2025 model year, albeit in standard-wheelbase guise. Much like it has done for decades with the combustion-engine Escalade, the new IQL represents the stretched version for those who want even more room for up to seven passengers. (Think of the relationship between the Chevy Tahoe and the longer but otherwise mechanically identical Suburban, and you've nailed it.) The new model's arrival means Cadillac will be able to offer two sizes, with a choice of powertrains, for its popular and profitable nameplate. Most of the IQL's extra length goes to more than 4 inches of additional legroom in the third row and the cargo area. There is also an extra inch of headroom. See All 11 Photos Like the regular Escalade IQ, there is an available Executive Second Row package with 12.6-inch personal screens, stowable tray tables, wireless phone chargers, a rear command center, and massaging seats that can be heated or cooled. The power-folding third row folds flat and there is an additional 12.2 cubic feet of storage in the frunk. Like the IQ, the IQL is packed with technology. It has the same 55-inch curved screen that spans the width of the vehicle. The infotainment system comes with a standard AKG 21-speaker audio system or the available 38-speaker system that increases to 42 speakers with the executive second row package. And it offers Dolby Atmos for richer sound and has 5G WiFi hotspot connected by OnStar. See All 11 Photos The Escalade IQL has GM’s large 24-module battery—the same one that is in the IQ and the GMC Hummer EV, with a capacity of 205 kWh. That provides an estimated 460 miles of range and 10 minutes of fast charging will top it up by 116 miles with its 800-volte fast-charging architecture. It has bidirectional charging so the SUV can be charged at home or be used to charge the home. In terms of grunt: 750 horsepower and 785 lb-ft of torque with Velocity Max, a power boost. That is good for a 0-60 mph time of 4.7 seconds, according to GM. Like the IQ, the IQL has independent front and rear suspension, magnetic ride control and adaptive air suspension, rear-wheel steering, standard Super Cruise, 24-inch wheels and 35-inch tires. It can tow 7,500 pounds. The Escalade IQL will go into production in mid-2025 at GM’s Factory Zero plant in Detroit and will be sold globally. It will be offered in four trims: Luxury, Sport, Premium Luxury, and Premium Sport. It starts at $132,695. 2026 Cadillac Escalade IQL Specfications  BASE PRICE $132,695 LAYOUT Front-and rear-motor, AWD, 7-pass, 4-door SUV MOTORS 750 hp/785 lb-ft electric TRANSMISSION 1-speed auto CURB WEIGHT 9,000 lb (est) WHEELBASE N/A L x W x H N/A 0–60 MPH 4.7 sec (mfr est) EPA FUEL ECON N/A EPA RANGE, COMB 460 miles (mf rest) ON SALE Summer 2025 Alisa Priddle joined MotorTrend in 2016 as the Detroit Editor.

TITLE: Kia PV5 Electric Van First Look: More Details on a Potential (Volkswagen) Buzz Kill
DATE: Feb 27, 2025
CONTENT:
This midsize box from Kia looks cool as-is—and cooler versions are coming. Alexander StoklosaWriterFeb 27, 2025 This midsize box from Kia looks cool as-is—and cooler versions are coming. Alexander StoklosaWriterFeb 27, 2025 See All 99 Photos Kia gave us the PV5 concept, its first answer to a question none of us were asking, frankly, before the 2024 CES in Las Vegas: What if the Korean brand built an awesome-looking, all-electric van that promised numerous variations including passenger, cargo, and (later) adventurous off-road campers? Well it is, and we dig it. The only open question for now is whether or not Kia will send the real-life, non-concept version of the PV5 just revealed today to America, where it could not only do battle with the electrified iterations of the Ram ProMaster, Ford Transit, and Mercedes-Benz Sprinter vans (as well as Rivian's released-from-Amazon-exclusivity Delivery 500 and 700 models), but also Volkswagen's hot new ID Buzz electric minivan. And, perhaps, even its corporate sibling, the Hyundai Staria, if we're lucky. It's a smallish (Kia calls it a "midsize," but that seems to be from an international, not American, perspective) electric van that mines battery and motor tech from elsewhere in the Hyundai-Kia product portfolio. At 184.8 inches long, 74.6 inches wide, and 74.8 inches tall (with a long 117.9-inch wheelbase), the PV5 fits in the shadow of a modern compact car such as a Honda Civic or Kia's own upcoming EV4 electric sedan. It is, of course, much taller, but within bounds—it's certainly more garage-able than any other commercial van on the market. Kia dubs this a "PBV," or "Platform Beyond Vehicle" intended to "fulfill the diverse needs of a broad customer base by providing unprecedented flexibility and customization through innovative modularity." Translated to simple-speak, this means the PV5's underpinnings will be flexible enough to allow for various lengths, roof heights, and configurations, two of which are on display now: Passenger and Cargo. A chassis-cab version will also be available. This flexibility is gleaned from Kia's E-GMP-S architecture, spun off from the regular E-GMP setup that underpins other EVs as varied in size as the smaller EV3 SIUV, upcoming EV4 compact, existing EV6 crossover, and three-row EV9 SUV. See All 99 Photos Even between those two, there are surprising differences, namely different rooflines and rear door treatments. The PV5 Passenger model has a swing-up liftgate, much like an ordinary minivan or hatchback, and a slightly more curved and stylish roofline and pillar arrangement. For the more utilitarian Cargo version, Kia squares up the roofline and installs a pair of clamshell rear doors that swing out to either side. Both look cool, though, and faithfully translate the blocky, futuristic appearance previewed by the PV5 concepts last year. The aesthetic is utilitarian, but interesting enough to not come off as commercial or basic, with interesting LED lighting bending around the short hood, chunky plastic bumpers, and vertical taillights bookending tall and almost flat side glass (at least on the passenger model). Even the wheels wear nifty little designs, though we expect more commercial-grade steel wheels to be available. Hell, those might even look cooler. See All 99 Photos Kia will build the PV5 in a specialized, highly flexible factory in Korea capable of churning out small batches of PV5 variants—effectively bringing the traditional art of commercial vehicle upfitting in-house. This means the PV5 and its spinoffs will deliver OEM-quality integrations, be they higher roofs or unusual door and seating configurations or 2+3 "crew" seating with a walled-off cargo hold behind the second row. Cargo models will be available with as small as a 43.3-kWh battery pack; the passenger and chassis cab models can only be had with 51.5-kWh or 71.2-kWh packs that also are available on the cargo. Total driving range is estimated at up to 249 miles, albeit on the optimistic WLTP test cycle. Here in America, expect a lower range—perhaps in line with the 230-some miles the Volkswagen ID Buzz delivers. Every PV5, it seems, is front-wheel-drive, powered by a 120-kW (161-hp), 184-lb-ft electric motor. Like other emerging affordable Kia EVs, the PV5 uses a 400-volt electrical architecture. Pricier models get 800-volt setups that are capable of charging more quickly, but even so, the PV5 is claimed to charge from 10 to 80 percent in 30 minutes on a DC fast charger. See All 99 Photos Kia promises further variations on the PV5 theme, "including derivative models and conversion options." We're hoping those include production-intent versions of the PV5 Wkndr off-road electric camper van concept shown late last year at the L.A. auto show. Among several listed brands Kia is working with on PV5 spinoffs, conspicuously, is Westfalia—the camper converter of note for classic VWs. Kia is mum on whether or not the PV5 will come to America; it's definitely going on sale next year in Europe, and we're told it'll also make it to Canada, but with trade instabilities and the fate of the EV tax credit here in America up in the air, Kia's wisely staying open to options. We figure that, if the PV5 were sold stateside, you can expect only passenger versions and those upfit for specific private uses, such as an accessible vehicle with ramps or even light weekender camper vans. Still, it's hard not to get excited about a compact-car-sized, three-row EV that's arguably more VW-bus-like than today's VW bus, the very expensive ID Buzz. With Kia promising a global starting price around $30,000, even tariffs or America's so-called "Chicken tax" on foreign-built trucks could mean a $40,000-ish MSRP—about twenty grand cheaper than the Volkswagen. An affordable all-electric family and lifestyle adventure vehicle with funky, very van-like style? We're all in.

TITLE: Is Ford Developing a 4-Door Mustang "Mach 4" Sedan? Trademarks and Dealer Leaks Suggest It Is
DATE: Feb 27, 2025
CONTENT:
And the Mustang sedan wasn’t the only eye-popping vehicle previewed, according to anonymous dealers in attendance. Andrew BeckfordWriterAlexander StoklosaIllustratorFeb 27, 2025 And the Mustang sedan wasn’t the only eye-popping vehicle previewed, according to anonymous dealers in attendance. Andrew BeckfordWriterAlexander StoklosaIllustratorFeb 27, 2025 See All 24 Photos Ever since Ford CEO Jim Farley said that the automaker could do “other Mustang body forms,” besides the traditional two-door coupe and convertible models, there has been talk of a four-door Mustang coming at some point in the future. If a new rumor and even a trademark filing are to be believed, we might be closer to that future than first thought. Automotive NewsandThe Drive report that Ford recently held a private dealer event in which renderings of a Ford Mustang sedan were shown. Naturally, phones and cameras weren’t allowed at the event, so this is all coming from four dealers in attendance who are choosing to remain anonymous. Two of the dealers revealed that Ford referred to the Mustang sedan as a “Mach-4” because puns are great and, well, that also sounds pretty cool. Now, that very name, "Mach 4," has been trademarked by Ford, as of Feb. 2025, as reported on by Ford Authority. See All 24 Photos Apparently, Ford didn’t stop at a Mustang sedan. The automaker also previewed an off-road Mustang, an EcoBoost-powered RTR Mustang, and a V-8-powered Mustang convertible with a manual transmission (though that last combo is currently available for 2024, so maybe it was a droptop positioned above the GT trim). Assuming that everything shown was a rendering or merely described verbally, then it could be quite a while before Ford is ready to publicly share what that group of dealers have already seen, but never say never. A four-door Mustang wouldn't be terribly difficult to pull off—we imagine Ford would merely stretch the current S650-generation platform, extending the wheelbase and adding a rear door. The door glass could be kept frameless for an even simpler transition, and the roofline likely would be extended and raised slightly to better accommodate rear seat occupants' heads. We've rendered what this could look like above, and, yep, it's a four-door Mustang. Pretty self-explanatory. Look for both EcoBoost four-cylinder and V-8-powered GT models to make the cut, while Ford could hold a Dark Horse–style track special in its back pocket depending on how Dodge develops its upcoming four-door, internal-combustion Charger sedans, which for now are slated to receive only the standard-output (S.O.) Hurricane inline-six engine good for 420 hp, while the coupe versions come only with the higher-output, 540-hp-plus version. Either way, Ford could corner the affordable-ish V-8 sedan market—Dodge's next-gen Chargers won't offer the Hemi V-8, while Chevy's Camaro is just as dead as the Hemi. See All 24 Photos We should point out that while no four-door Mustang proper has ever been sold by Ford, in away, that ice was broken when the company introduced the all-electric Mustang Mach-E. That was the first all-new Mustang variant since, well, the Mustang itself debuted in 1964. It's technically a different model and totally unrelated to the traditional Mustang (at least, mechanically), though it also showed Ford is serious about expanding the Mustang family beyond one nameplate, and into new and interesting territory (cough, cough, the $325,000 Mustang GTD, cough cough). For an idea of what Ford might be up to with this sedan and the other variants mentioned above, look no further than the Bronco lineup—which numbers two (for now), with the larger body-on-frame, Jeep-chasing Bronco and the smaller, car-based Bronco Sport that still delivers solid off-road performance but with better on-road dynamics and efficiency. In this case, a Mustang sedan might offer Ford dealerships a more practical but still sporty option to woo customers, especially given what the competition is up to. As mentioned, cross-town rival Dodge is in the midst of switching its Charger muscle car over to a new dual-power-capable platform, launching all-electric Charger Daytonas by the end of the year (pictured above), followed by gas-fed, six-cylinder non-Daytona variants dubbed Six Packs, and both versions will be sold in two-door coupe and four-door sedan body styles. (The Challenger name is gone, and now every Charger, regardless of door count, will be named Charger.) Chevy has been rumored to be bringing the Camaro back as an electric sport sedan, too, so there are a lot of four-door sedans swimming or jumping into the Mustang's waters. It only makes sense that Ford would let a similar pony out of its corral.

TITLE: Kia Concept EV2 First Look: Shrunken EV With Even Smaller Price, But Huge Style
DATE: Feb 27, 2025
CONTENT:
Will America get this hot little electric SUV? Probably not, but it'd sure be cheap... Alexander StoklosaWriterFeb 27, 2025 Will America get this hot little electric SUV? Probably not, but it'd sure be cheap... Alexander StoklosaWriterFeb 27, 2025 See All 39 Photos Look, there's no getting around it: Small cars and the U.S. market tend not to mix. That goes doubly for, say, small electric vehicles, which carry the extra cost burden of a battery pack—small cars tend to be cheap, after all, so more expensive versions end up competing with larger cars on price. They usually lose those battles (count how many new-generation Fiat 500e hatchbacks you've seen lately—we'll wait). So it's highly unlikely we'll ever see Kia's new EV2 in America, even though it'd surely give the aforementioned Fiat, Mini's new electric Cooper, and even Volvo's EX30 a run for their money here. Shown in concept form in Spain, a place where it's definitely going on sale (along with the rest of Europe), the four-door EV2 is more spacious and usefully shaped than the two-door Fiat 500e and electric Mini Cooper. It's also taller, enough so it convincingly comes across as a small SUV—most credit goes to the black plastic bumper and fender cladding, but the boxy roofline and tall greenhouse help, too. In fact, the EV2's bulldog stance rather closely resembles the new Volvo EX30's upright, pugnacious look. See All 39 Photos Kia has gone in its own direction, style-wise, with the baseline elements within the EV2's shape, though. The headlights are thin, vertical slashes with smaller running lamps closer to the vehicle's centerline looking for all the world like nose piercings. There are also more prominent openings in the EV2's face than on the smooth-snooted EX30, particularly a series of horizontal openings that resemble conventional internal combustion vehicles' grilles. Around back, Kia designers blended the taillights into the trailing edges of each rear fender, leaving the majority of the EV2's butt a smooth, body-color panel. The lower bodywork is covered in black plastic punctuated by silvery, metal-look trim. Again, this is where most of the EV2's "ruggedness" begins and ends. But the contrast of the body armor helps the EV2's painted surfaces pop and helps show off the sheetmetal's clean surfacing. As ever, Kia has fitted the EV2 with wild-looking, geometric wheel design, in this case a quadrant of square spokes forming an "X" around a central, square hub with Kia's newest logo. In size, the EV2 concept is barely smaller than Volvo's new EX30, another B-segment, subcompact electric SUV. At 159.8 inches long, 70.9 inches wide, and 62 inches tall, the Kia is about six inches shorter and 1.5 inches narrower than the Volvo—but it's about 1 inch taller, and its 101-inch wheelbase is only 3.3 inches stubbier. That means the EV2's interior seems roomier than the external dimensions suggest—and it's even more so given the surely show-car-exclusive sliding front and rear bench seats with impossibly thin cushions and backrests. See All 39 Photos Another show-car flourish we expect to be ditched before the EV2 goes on sale? The clamshell side doors, whose yawning opening, again, visually overestimate the small SUV's cabin spaciousness somewhat. We weren't allowed to sit inside the EV2, but standing next to it, there seems to be only slightly less room in the rear seat than in the one-size-up Kia EV3. Of course, there is way, way less space in the trunk, which appears to have the depth of a carry-on suitcase. It'd surely be even smaller if the EV2 had a second electric motor for the rear axle; as it sits, the EV2 is front-wheel-drive with a single motor up front, and a battery of unspecified capacity (delivering yet-to-be-specified driving range) underneath the floor. Like the larger, compact EV4, it'll rely on a 400-volt electrical architecture rather than the faster-charging 800-volt setup in larger Kia EVs. But Kia insists a number of clever interior features will make the leap to showrooms when the EV2 goes on sale, namely the various storage bins that slide out from beneath the seats and the front seats that can slide all the way back until they hit the rear seats (whose lower cushions can be flipped vertically to make even more room), creating a sort of lounge atmosphere (again, assuming no legs and/or people are present in the rear seats), a useful configuration for passing time luxuriously while waiting for the EV2 to charge at a public station. Removable speakers also seem entirely feasible for production (other brands have pulled off similar tricks), as does the console-free front floor area (it's an EV—no need for a transmission tunnel!). Kia's designers appear to have carved a maximum amount of cabin volume from the EV2's footprint, and far from making the interior style boring, this practicality elevates the look. The contrast-color dashboard pad, for example, extends subtly onto each front door, visually widening the space, while the simple surfaces and integration of most buttons into the thin trim shelf running width-wise across the dashboard lend it an upscale vibe. Squint, and it isn't hard to imagine Kia's dual 12.3-inch screens (sandwiching a 5-inch climate control display) found in its other production cars replacing the slightly more concept-car-like units on the dashboard, too. That Salvador Dalí melting steering wheel, on the other hand? You can probably forget it. See All 39 Photos Before you get too excited by the EV2, let's face some hard realities: While Kia claims this electric SUV will go on sale in Europe for roughly €30,000, or about $31,000, it probably wouldn't be able to drag the cost down so low here in America. Trade instabilities, along with the wavering $7,500 EV tax credit—which an imported EV2 couldn't qualify for, anyway, outside of a lease—would put extreme pressures on such a low price claim. It's not impossible, and the EV2 utilizes Kia's E-GMP architecture spread across its entire EV lineup, a scale that surely helps keep the lid on component pricing. And such a price would ensure the Kia undercuts the Fiat, Mini, and Volvo, but consider that Hyundai already sells a slightly larger B-segment electric SUV, the Kona, here, and its pricing starts nearly $10,000 higher. The upcoming EV4 sedan, which is larger than the EV2, is targeted to come in around $37,000. As ever, small cars have small price windows, and the EV2 would be squeezed by the EV4 and EV3 SUV—which is expected to come to America, likely in 2026—both of which would be rolling excuses to spend a little more to pass on the tiny EV2. Sales of the Fiat 500e should be a clear enough warning to Kia that Americans aren't huge fans of relatively expensive small cars, meaning subcompacts priced in midsize sedan territory. Kia's own CEO also says he's hoping the company can make the case to customers for all of its EVs with a cost-of-ownership angle. As he sees it, sure, an EV4 costs more than a similar Kia K4 with a gas engine—but the up-front price differences are only a few thousand bucks, and the EV4 will ultimately cost far less to own and run. Surely the EV2 will also win out on similar cost-of-ownership metrics against, say, Kia's own gas-fed Soul hatchback. But when the Soul is so much less expensive to buy up front, such nuanced analysis will probably be lost on MSRP-conscious customers shopping in that affordable space. For now, Kia has made no plans to bring the EV2 to America, and it's promising only that it'll be available in Europe, and soon.

TITLE: Can We Please Get EV Motors Out of the Actual Car?
DATE: Mar 05, 2025

Porsche raced hub motors 127 years ago. Now Orbis offers the torque, cost, and unsprung weight that may finally move motors back out to our wheels. Frank MarkusWriterManufacturerPhotographerRyan LugoIllustratorMar 05, 2025 Porsche raced hub motors 127 years ago. Now Orbis offers the torque, cost, and unsprung weight that may finally move motors back out to our wheels. Frank MarkusWriterManufacturerPhotographerRyan LugoIllustratorMar 05, 2025 See All 12 Photos Nineteenth-century electric cars were as likely to use inboard motors as they were wheel-hub motors. OG car-guy Ferdinand Porsche raced a wheel-hub-motored EV in Vienna, Austria, in 1897, and Lohnerand others built production versions from 1900 to 1920. Porsche employed a direct drive that eliminated the friction of a geared or chain drive, but his motors also lacked the torque multiplication such drives offer. So the copper and iron required to generate sufficient torque to accelerate his heavy batteries resulted in 320-pound motors. That much unsprung weight seriously degrades a vehicle’s ride quality and dynamic handling while adding considerable cost, and motors at the wheels experience way more shock, vibration, and risk of contamination. As a result, few EVs have used wheel-hub motors since. (Lightyear and Lordstown Motors produced a few such vehicles before going bankrupt, each using Elaphe wheel-hub motors.) But recent developments indicate the concept is ripe for a renaissance—like the $30 million investment BMW just made in hub motor supplier DeepDrive. Back in 2018, Orbis Wheels demonstrated a hub-mounted motor that solved Porsche’s torque-multiplication problem by driving a pinion gear that spun a ring gear on the wheel. We tested Orbis’ proof-of-concept vehicle, a Honda Civic Type R with two 50-hp/70-lb-ft e-bike motors driving the rear wheels. They shaved 1.7 seconds off the 0–60 time. By also employing a small brake caliper engaging the inside of a larger-diameter, thinner, wheel-mounted rotor, weight savings in the brake system effectively offset the motor’s unsprung weight. That setup was hopelessly noisy and fragile, but continuous innovation and development has refined it sufficiently that it’s now attracting OEM and aftermarket production interest. See All 12 Photos “Pancake” style axial-flux motors sandwich a disclike permanent-magnet rotor between stator discs. Orbis’ version is tunable in two ways: For the strongest, skinniest setup imaginable, spec a single rotor fitted with rare-earth magnets. Applications with a bit more depth but less budget to work with can fit a second rotor and use domestic ferrite magnets. Orbis can fine-tune output by blending rare-earth and ferrite magnets on the rotors. Reducing rare-earth materials lowers cost and sourcing woes, reduces heat generated, improves efficiency, and allows motors to cope better with “field weakening” at higher speeds (stator field strength drops, lowering torque while maintaining constant power). This allows one basic design to deliver between 184 and 738 lb-ft. Those figures sound impressive in our motor-shaft output frame of reference, but today’s EV motors power a reduction drive that multiplies the torque—typically by something like 8:1. Orbis achieves torque multiplication at the wheel hub using a simple planetary reduction gear that fits roughly the space otherwise consumed by a halfshaft’s constant-velocity joint and provides multiplication ranging from 2.50:1 to 5.25:1. This is not a new idea: In 1884, Missourian Wellington Adams was awarded U.S. patent US300827A for a similar concept applied to an electric train wheel motor. Today such reduction gearing is somewhat common in e-bikes, but no other established player in the EV wheel-motor game uses it. And Orbis’ internal gearing solution already meets OEM noise targets. OEMs looking to get an affordable PHEV to market can electrify an undriven axle with two rare-earth-free single-rotor 184-lb-ft motors capable of delivering between 922 and 1,936 lb-ft to the axle, depending on gearing. Switching to rare-earth magnets or adding a second pair of rotors doubles those numbers; doing both doubles them again. These two little wheel-hub motors therefore can simulate a single inboard motor running 8:1 gearing that makes between 115 and 968 lb-ft.  Orbis Electric Output, lb-ft Single Rotor Dual Rotor  Output at the motor 184 369 369 738 Axle 2.50:1 motor gear 922 1,844 1,844 3,688 Torque 5.25:1 motor gear 1,936 3,872 3,872 7,744 With 0 percent rare-earth magnets (e.g. ferrite) With 100 percent rare-earth magnets (e.g. neodymium) A major global OEM held an event to evaluate hub-motor options for electrifying existing vehicles, inviting DeepDrive, Elaphe, Protean, and Orbis. Before evaluating these motors, it outfitted a combustion sports car from its range with about 50 pounds of dead weight added to each wheel at one axle. Only three participants could correctly identify which of two otherwise identical cars bore the added unsprung mass. Still, extensive experience optimizing torque per mass gave Orbis a specific-torque advantage, delivering 49 to 117 percent better wheel-torque/weight than its direct-drive competitors. Orbis’ demo motors added about 25 pounds at each corner, but production-grade ones would only add about 5 pounds, and the car should end up at least 50 to 100 pounds lighter. These savings enable switching from NMC batteries to cheaper, bulkier, heavier iron-phosphate chemistry with little or no range, cost, weight, or packaging penalty. The OEM demo was based on a legacy EV model with the inboard motor removed. The test car was battery-power constrained to roughly half the total rated output of Orbis’ two motors, leaving 0–60 performance unchanged, but the demo car gained torque-vectoring capability, and removing the inboard motor freed up useful passenger/cargo volume. Because the motor housing serves as the suspension upright and conducts all tire-to-suspension loads, it’s very rigid. Sealing is to IP67 standards (dust tight and water-tight for 30 minutes at 3 feet deep), and Orbis retains OEM wheel bearings. And with proper strain-relief precautions, the high-voltage wiring and glycol coolant plumbing connections aren’t problematic. Orbis spent two years certifying a kit to electrify the non-driven axle of a delivery van that takes just three hours to install. On a Ford Transit, using a 14-kWh NMC battery in a market where fuel costs $5 per gallon should return $2,650 in annual fuel savings, easily paying back a $16,000 upfront cost. And the above global OEM’s PHEV fitment shares a platform with a North American market vehicle that’s popular with the tuner set, so there’s aftermarket interest in productionizing an Orbis AWD retrofit kit (perhaps with media drives later this year). Did you know refrigerated semi-trailers use their own diesel engines? All-electric alternatives require a very large battery plus Level 2 or Level 3 charging. Using simpler air-cooled versions of Orbis wheel motors to generate power—23 kW during braking, 9 kW continuous while cruising—allows the battery size to be cut in half. This setup is already on sale, helping lower costs to electrify refrigerated trucking fleets. I have to wonder: Where would the world be right now had Ferdinand Porsche met Wellington Adams back in the day? Might lightweight, geared electric hub motors have established a powertrain status quo? See All 12 Photos Orbis’ modular design allows the basic package shown, measuring 16.5 inches in diameter by 4.3 inches wide and adding less than 25 un-sprung pounds, to deliver between 461 and 1,936 lb-ft to each wheel with a single rotor, depending on gearing and rare-earth magnet loading. Adding a second rotor widens the package by 2.4 inches, adds about 10 lb, and ups wheel-torque output to 922–3,872 lb-ft. In this image, the rotor connects to the sun gear, while the drum, brake disc, and wheel connect to the planet carrier. The ring gear remains stationary. See All 12 Photos Packaging miracle: That’s the gear reduction drive packaged in that “hat” where a CV joint would go, in between existing production suspension links. The service and parking brake caliper swings inboard to remove the disc and outer “bell” motor housing for service. Electrical lines (orange) and coolant hoses (black) are designed to flex through full suspension travel. See All 12 Photos The lime green portion of the motor remains stationary; the black “spokes” that turn with the wheel also attach to the brake rotor. I started critiquing cars at age 5 by bumming rides home from church in other parishioners’ new cars. At 16 I started running parts for an Oldsmobile dealership and got hooked on the car biz. Engineering seemed the best way to make a living in it, so with two mechanical engineering degrees I joined Chrysler to work on the Neon, LH cars, and 2nd-gen minivans. Then a friend mentioned an opening for a technical editor at another car magazine, and I did the car-biz equivalent of running off to join the circus. I loved that job too until the phone rang again with what turned out to be an even better opportunity with Motor Trend.

Aston Martin built the one-off Cygnet for a special owner in 2018, who is now finally giving it up to someone else. Justin WestbrookWriterFeb 28, 2025 Aston Martin built the one-off Cygnet for a special owner in 2018, who is now finally giving it up to someone else. Justin WestbrookWriterFeb 28, 2025 See All 11 Photos What if we told you there was a Toyota-based city car with Aston Martin flourishes and a V-8 engine producing more than 400 horsepower, and you could buy this vehicle today? Sounds crazy, but there's a new listing from the Nicholas and Mee company in England for the iconic one-off Aston Martin "Super Cygnet" V-8, one of the wildest production cars ever built. A few years ago, Aston Martin made a deal to produce its own version of the plucky and tiny Toyota/Scion iQ city car to help balance out its lineup of otherwise high-horsepower and inefficient sports and super cars and drag down its average fleet carbon emissions. Nowadays you'd just build an EV, but back then, it was city cars with tiny engines. However, the original Cygnet kept the Toyota powertrain, which was obviously a disappointment to most potential Aston owners. One special customer requested a V-8 model, and the crazy British brand actually went and built just one for him. Now it's finally for sale for someone else to enjoy. See All 11 Photos Aston Martin's so-called Q modification division went to work on the Cygnet, which was originally introduced in 2009 with a 97-hp 1.33-liter four-cylinder gas engine, with the entire car weighing in at just a hair over 3,000 pounds wet. Ten months later, the "Super Cygnet" would leave the shop with a 4.7-liter V-8 sourced from the Vantage S sports car making 430 hp sent through a seven-speed paddle-shift gearbox to the rear wheels. The crazy creation has a claimed top speed of 170 mph and gets from 0-60 mph in 4.2 seconds, though Aston's own driver only ever got it up to 155 mph. See All 11 Photos Much of the car is bespoke, with a unique Buckinghamshire Green paint job, carbon wheel arch extensions, and five-spoke wheels with Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2 rubber. Inside there's a carbon fiber and black alcantara treatment wedged around a full installed roll cage for safety (obviously a concern here), and the Vantage's instrument panel. The car so far has been an event darling since 2018, and is welcome at probably any concours or event celebrating unique motors. It made its debut at the Goodwood Festival of Speed, even. Now, it can be yours. Pricing is a "if you have to ask" notion, but it's been well maintained by Aston itself, professionally stored for most of its life, and only has 2,900 miles on the clock. Let us know if you buy it... we've already driven it before, but we would love to try to help someone hit that claimed 170 mph top speed some day, track and personal sanity permitting.

The automotive conglomerate’s impressive performance with an ongoing upward trajectory cement Muñoz on top of our Power List. Alisa PriddleWriterRyan LugoIllustratorFeb 27, 2025 The automotive conglomerate’s impressive performance with an ongoing upward trajectory cement Muñoz on top of our Power List. Alisa PriddleWriterRyan LugoIllustratorFeb 27, 2025 See All 3 Photos Ranked 15th on our list last year, Jose Muñoz steps into the history books as the first non-Korean to lead the conglomerate that includes the Hyundai, Kia, and Genesis brands. It is a surprising advancement but one that is well deserved. Muñoz has been a driving force, leading Hyundai through years of record growth in North American sales, market share, revenue, and profitability. Muñoz has had an interesting career. The Spanish native and U.S. citizen has a Ph.D. in nuclear engineering as well as an executive MBA. He spent 15 years at Nissan, where he was positioned to take over as CEO after the arrest and ouster of the company’s former CEO, Carlos Ghosn. Muñoz joined his present employer in 2019 as president and global chief operating officer of Hyundai as well as president and CEO of Hyundai and Genesis in North America. His duties expanded as he added Europe, India, the Middle East, Africa, and Asia Pacific to the regions under his purview. He first broke the cultural ceiling when he became a board member in 2023 and shattered it when, effective January 1, 2025, he succeeded president and CEO Jaehoon Chang, who was promoted to vice chair of Hyundai, Automotive Division. Muñoz is now in charge of the company’s global business. Hyundai has come a long way since it entered the U.S. market in 1986 with the Excel, a subcompact car improving on the Pony, which the manufacturer began exporting to Canada in 1984 but didn't sell in the U.S. because it didn’t meet emissions standards. The Hyundai brand, known initially for value and affordability, has matured and is now associated with quality, good value, and enough cachet and gravitas to warrant adding the Genesis luxury division. We’ve been so impressed with the group’s contemporary offerings in recent times that we named the Genesis GV70 the 2022 MotorTrend SUV of the Year and the Hyundai Ioniq 5 our 2023 SUV of the Year. Under Muñoz, Hyundai’s North American sales have seen constant growth, hitting 801,200 units in 2023 and 836,802 in 2024. Global sales of all three brands totaled 7.23 million in 2024. And there is more to come with new models like the Ioniq 9 EV and a new plant ramping up. See All 3 Photos Indeed, Hyundai broke ground on its first U.S. plant in 2002 in Montgomery, Alabama. The latest: a $12.6 billion investment that includes the Metaplant America in Georgia, with a $6.7 billion assembly plant and two joint-venture battery factories with LG Energy Solution and SK On. Hyundai began building electric vehicles at the new facility in October. Much of Hyundai’s success is attributed to the automaker’s multipowertrain product strategy, which created the world’s most diverse and fulsome portfolio. When other automakers pulled back on EV plans, Hyundai stayed the course. Hyundai Motor Group was America’s second bestselling electric vehicle automaker in 2024 even though its models were not eligible for U.S. tax credits, placing it at a cost disadvantage versus competitors. The world’s third-largest car company has big plans. It aims to offer 21 EV models by 2030, with annual global EV sales of 2 million. The number of hybrids will double to 14, including some for Genesis. All models will get a second generation of Hyundai’s existing hybrid system, and the group is also developing extended-range hybrid systems that use an internal combustion engine as a generator to recharge the electric motor powering the vehicle. The goal is to increase global hybrid sales to 1.33 million vehicles in 2028, a huge jump from 510,000 now. The hike will be even greater in North America, where hybrid sales are expected to more than triple to 690,000 in 2028, up from about 170,000. See All 3 Photos Muñoz has managed successful growth to date, and with expanded responsibilities he will continue to oversee the corporation’s broader mobility vision, including multiple modes and forms of transportation and propulsion, from regular cars to motorsports to flying taxis, propelled by conventional powertrains, electric motors, and hydrogen. He must also focus on managing the conglomerate to continue growing and strengthening the brands’ global status. This includes continuing the grand experiment of selling cars on Amazon, using his experience in the U.S. to deal with challenges posed by the new Trump administration, and getting the Hyundai Supernal SA-2 flying car off the ground. Already, though, Muñoz has more than earned his top spot on our Power List, and he shows no signs of slowing down or making major missteps. READ THE FULL 2025 MOTORTREND POWER LIST!

TITLE: Tesla Plans To Give "Some Love" to Aging Model S and X Later This Year
DATE: Mar 04, 2025
CONTENT:
The American EV automaker apparently plans to update its original electric sedan and SUV. Justin WestbrookWriterMar 04, 2025 The American EV automaker apparently plans to update its original electric sedan and SUV. Justin WestbrookWriterMar 04, 2025 See All 22 Photos The Tesla lineup was always intended to dump a high tech product on the market that is advanced enough to not need any updates for a few years longer than your standard car's refresh cycle, but some have complained that the automaker's wares are growing a bit too stale—particularly its earlier efforts, the Model S sedan and Model X SUV. These larger offerings are the oldest vehicles on sale from Tesla, having seen only minor updates over the years; the S, for example, is nearly 13 years old. That could change later in 2025 with updates to both models, if a guy on a podcast is supposed to be believed. It's not just some guy on some podcast, however. The quote comes from Tesla's Vice President of Vehicle Engineering, Lars Moravy on the Ride the Lightning podcast. He claims "The upgrade [to the Model S and X] a few years ago was bigger than most people thought in terms of architecture and structure. We’ll give it some love later this year. Everyone here has a little place in their heart for S/X. They are not going anywhere anytime soon." Those updates a few years back he's referring to included some styling tweaks, particularly to the S, along with some under-the-skin changes, most of which would be considered equivalent to a typical mid-cycle refresh, not a total redesign. There was also the addition of the super powerful, super quick Plaid variants of both the S and X. So, what are these fresh changes we expect, with what little information we have? Well for the Model S, beyond standard improvements to range and the interior materials, we expect the turn indicators to move to the steering wheel, as they have on the Model 3 and Y, and on the exterior there is sure to be at least one, if not two full light bars, front and rear to mimic the recent updates to the Model 3 and Model Y vehicles. The Model S will have fresh competition from Volvo's coming ES90 sedan that debuts in March, expected to offer more than 400 miles of range, but the Volvo isn't likely to be as quick and sporty as the Tesla. See All 22 Photos The Model X is where we could potentially see the biggest and most dramatic changes, namely the long overdue elimination of the troublesome power-operated "falcon wing" rear doors on the SUV. It's possible Tesla could simplify the vehicle with traditional rear doors, however, retooling for that could be cost prohibitive and it may be more affordable, and better marketing, to keep the funky door setup as is and make changes elsewhere. Those other changes likely include improvements to the interior materials, a moving of the indicators, and an exterior refresh in line with the Model 3 and Model Y look with light bars front and rear. Tesla is now in sales decline in the U.S., rapidly losing market share and sales to new competitors, and the company now has to deal with a very political CEO. Like him or not, it means more spotlight and more potential for backlash. Updating the S and X could improve sales of both vehicles, which surely generate higher profits than Tesla's more affordable cars, but not enough to reverse Tesla's unfortunate trends. Still, it should make for better product on the road, and we look forward to testing them out when they go on sale.

TITLE: 2026 Kia EV4 First Look: Smaller Size,  Smaller Price, Crazy Style
DATE: Feb 27, 2025
CONTENT:
Kia's latest electric car is a styling hot shot aimed at the mass market. Alexander StoklosaWriterFeb 27, 2025 Kia's latest electric car is a styling hot shot aimed at the mass market. Alexander StoklosaWriterFeb 27, 2025 See All 66 Photos The regulatory climate surrounding EVs might be in flux, but Kia is pressing forward with an aggressive expansion of its electric vehicle offerings regardless. And why not? Kia doesn't seem to need government help building appealing EVs such as the big new EV9 three-row SUV, sporty EV6 crossover, or forthcoming EV5 compact SUV. Next to be flushed down the product pipeline—er, zapped across the wire? The super affordable (and small) EV3 SUV, though it might not make it stateside, and these, the all-new 2026 EV4 sedan and hatchback models. The EV4 made its official debut at what Kia is calling its "2025 EV Day," an EV-focused event in Spain. And while we were also shown the EV4 hatchback, we'll pop your balloon up front: Only the sedan is coming here, likely early next year. The bigger news, however, is the expected price: Kia suggests the EV4 sedan will cost about $37,000 bucks when it lands stateside—and it made no carve-out for the $7,500 EV tax credit in that price, which we're taking to mean $37,000 will be the MSRP. Any government incentives would just be gravy on top, if they're still around in a year, of course... See All 66 Photos In case you're staggered by the EV4's wild, concept-car looks, allow us to ground you somewhat with its (actual) size. The EV4 is a compact car, though it's notably smaller than the Ioniq 6 electric sedan built by Kia's corporate cousin, Hyundai, measuring a few inches shorter in length, about an inch narrower, and half an inch shorter in height, with a significant 5.1-inches-shorter wheelbase. This does not mean the EV4 is "small," though—it simply places it in line with conventional compact cars you're familiar with, namely the Honda Civic and Toyota Corolla, as well as Kia's own gas-fed K4. Another differentiator? The EV4 is front-wheel drive, with a single front-mounted motor spinning out 150 kW of power (that's 201 hp); the Ioniq 6 is offered in both single- and dual-motor (all-wheel drive) configurations, but the two-wheel-drive version has its more powerful (225 hp) motor mounted arrears, driving the rear wheels. Other than their arrangement beneath the EV4's bodywork, the primary electric components—drive motor, battery, etc.—are shared with other E-GMP platform cars, including the Ioniq 6, Kia's own EV6 and EV9, and others. Kia is so far promising Standard and Long Range battery options, with the former holding 58.3 kWh and the latter a beefier 81.4 kWh. Both utilize a 400-volt setup, a step down from the Ioniq 6's 800-volt architecture; this impacts charging times, if only slightly. The Standard Range EV4 can be DC fast-charged from 10 to 80 percent in 29 minutes, while the Long Range needs 31 minutes. Equivalent Ioniq 6s can do the same deed in as little as 18 minutes. Range numbers are looking good so far, though we only have European-market WLTP results so far (these tend to be optimistic relative to EPA numbers). Standard Range EV4s are good for 267 miles (again, via WLTP, with hatchbacks dropping to 255 miles), and Long Range models deliver between 360 miles (hatch) and 391 miles (sedan). Look for those numbers to drop about 10 to 20 percent when evaluated by the EPA, though they'd remain solid. Interestingly, the Standard Range EV4's battery pack is smaller than the equivalent Ioniq 6's, while its Long Range pack is larger—something to keep in mind given the Ioniq 6's range figures span 240 miles on the low end to 361 on the high end. See All 66 Photos When the EV4 goes on sale next year, unless another automaker debuts a wilder-looking compact car, the EV4 will be the show-stealer in its segment. It even makes the Hyundai Ioniq 6, itself a vaguely Porsche-esque design with lots of crazy aerodynamic add-ons and wings, look normal. A Tesla Model 3 will fast become automotive wallpaper. After its recent in-photos debut, we thought the EV4 seemed interesting, if a little awkwardly detailed. In person, the EV4 tries stealing the glances of everyone nearby with its angularity and wide-set vertical LED lighting. We bet Cadillac designers are eating their hearts out right now—that's how successful the EV4's tall headlights are. Approach the EV4 from the front, and those LED slashes placed way out at the corners and the stubby, plunging hood make the car seem very wide. Walk around to the sides, and the Kia seems to stretch on and on—a clever visual trick of the tapered rear end, since, again, the EV4 is about the same size as a Civic. There is still a lot going on in the details, with intersecting cut lines, odd mixes of body-color and black-painted elements—especially around the roof—but the effect is more successful here than on Kia's conventionally powered K4 sedan, which is essentially this EV's gas-fed analogue. While some might lament the hatchback's exclusion from the U.S. market (for now), we think the sedan wears this styling better. The hatch is over eight inches shorter than the sedan, with all of that chopped from behind its rear wheels. As such, it suffers a severe case of pancake butt, and its T-shaped taillights seem ripped off the newest Chevy SUVs. And the sedan's long booty affords it a roomy boot, er, trunk—while the hatch's stunted length leaves its cargo hold relatively shallow front-to-back, though of course there is more vertical space than in the sedan. Eyeballing the two cargo areas, they seem about the same in size, just with the sedan's laid down and the hatch's standing upright. The hatchback also loses the EV4 sedan's more interesting double-bubble roof spoiler—yes, the four-door has winglets over the rear glass!—and width-emphasizing vertical taillights. Kia also claims the sedan wears the more slippery shape, slick enough for a super low 0.23 drag coefficient. See All 66 Photos While in Spain to meet the EV4, Kia let us loose on local roads in the new EV3—which we previously drove in Korea—giving us a great opportunity to preview the EV4's cabin, as the two models share a lot. The centerpiece is a pair of 12.3-inch digital displays sandwiching a vertical 5-inch screen for climate controls, combined into one unit and perched atop the dashboard. It's the same as the gear installed in the EV3 (and a host of other recent Kia products), and it both looks great and works well (aside from the smaller HVAC screen's visual blockage by the steering wheel rim). But peer closely at the photos of the EV4's cabin here, then check out the EV3's—and you'll notice a lot of the same bits, just arranged on a slightly different canvas of door panels and dashboard components. Perhaps because all of these pieces look and operate so well, you won't notice or care that they also appear in other Kias. In fact, you'll appreciate the economies of scale they bring to the EV4's price tag, which Kia is claiming will be around $37,000 to start when it goes on sale here in America. With no mention of asterisks like "with the $7,500 EV tax credit included," we're taking that to mean the actual MSRP will be $37,000 and up. That's mega affordable for an EV in this class, with this much style. Hyundai's Ioniq 6 costs a little more, as does Tesla's Model 3 (though it qualifies for the tax credit, for now). We're genuinely excited to drive this EV4, and to see whether Kia eventually adds a second motor to the mix. Hey, it showed off the car in regular and sportier-looking GT-Line trim, though for now that GT-Line gets no extra performance, and we'd love to see the EV6 GT's 576-hp dual-motor arrangement in this smaller, lighter, and even wilder-looking EV4...

TITLE: From Dirt to Dealerships? The 2025 Chevrolet Silverado EV ZR2 Concept Is Ready to Race

Andrew BeckfordWriterManufacturerPhotographerMar 06, 2025 See All 7 Photos Generally speaking, when an OEM reveals a concept car, it’s a dressed-up model that can only be driven at a snail’s pace lest something fall off. Chevrolet is bucking that trend and going full-send with its 2025 Silverado EV ZR2 off-road race truck concept. The “concept” truck is set to tackle the Mint 400 race in Las Vegas, NV. Now this isn’t official confirmation that a Silverado EV ZR2 is coming to a dealership near you, but we would feel fairly confident that it’s going to happen. When detailing the off-road race concept truck Chevrolet admits that it uses “98% GM production parts.” The automaker also said that the Silverado EV ZR2 follows “the same formula” as the gas Silverado ZR2 and Colorado ZR2. The concept has off-road tuned and lifted suspension, Multimatic dampers, locking differentials, and underbody skid protection. The suspension is set up for 13-inches of front and rear wheel travel for encounters with challenging terrain and a set of 37-inch BF Goodrich KM3 Mud-Terrain tires to claw through as much dirt as possible. Unlike the current Silverado EV RST the ZR2 concept truck has a tri-motor set up which is likely borrowed from the Hummer EV 3X, but with the power turned up to 1,100 hp and 11,500 lb-ft of torque. Does that mean a potential production-version Silverado EV ZR2 will have the same powertrain? It seems likely, though the power and torque may be turned down a few notches. See All 7 Photos Then again, maybe not? Don’t forget that the 2026 Silverado EV Trail Boss is set to release this summer and if a production ZR2 is coming, it needs to stand above the Trail Boss in the trim lineup. So, perhaps four-digit horsepower and five-digit torque isn’t so far-fetched after all. We also have to imagine that some adjustments will have to be made to the chassis and bed to accommodate two motors in the rear without sacrificing some packaging in the rear. Chevrolet is possibly testing out possible solutions to that issue with this concept as well as putting the drivetrain through its paces in extreme conditions. If you want to follow the 2025 Silverado EV ZR2’s performance, check out the Mint 400 happening March 5th-9th.
